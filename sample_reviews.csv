"1",4,"Just had a couple of days in London. Picked this hotel as it was close to where I needed to be and pretty central to everything else. Haven't stayed in a Thistle Hotel for a while as have become confirmed Marriott fans. It has made a change to do something different. Although, the room was probably the smallest I have ever stayed in, it had everything you could need for a short stay. There was only a shower, no bath, but what a shower!!! It was wonderful - a full power shower and worthy of several uses in one day!! The breakfast was also the best breakfast we have had, possibly ever. The choices were fantastic and everything was topped up constantly. There was no rush, you could stay as long as you liked.The staff were attentive and readily available should you need them. I would definitely recommend this hotel if you just need a base whilst in London - but maybe not if you intend to spend much time in your room. One last thing: 5 minutes after arriving in our room, I received a call from reception to ask if everything was okay. Maybe if I had said the room was too small I might have been moved but I will never know as I said it was fine!! (This was a really nice touch and it has left a bench mark impression).","en"
"2",5,"Found this hotel on late rooms. We were looking for somewhere near to Leicester Square/ Covent Garden . It's a good 10 min walk, just perfect! It's tucked in a street behind the Dominion Theatre. There is an Ncp car park more or less opposite. £38 for 24 hrs. We stayed for one night . This hotel was lovely and quiet. The beautiful scents as you walk in are smelt all around the hotel. Very clean.Staff were very attentive. We were given an upgrade too on arrival! Room was lovely. Gowns/ slippers provided , also free bottled water , which had been replaced when we returned to our room in the evening. Beds were turned too. We had drinks in the bar before we went out. Reasonable priced I felt. £7.50 for a glass of wine, £13 for a cocktail. Again very relaxed atmosphere, in fact we stayed here until 11.30 before walking to Leicester Square . The barman was brilliant. Breakfast was good, cooked to order . We payed £18 each when we arrived for this . Only negative was with our bill, we were charged for the room which we had already payed for , but this was soon rectified. Would definitely recommend and will definitely be back.","en"
"3",5,"This was our first stay at the hotel and we were glad we made the change from our usual haunts. As it is a smaller hotel it has a real boutique feel and the staff are excellent. We made use of the rolls which was a lovely change from the usual black cab journey to our restaurant. All in all a great stay and we will certainly be back.","en"
"4",4,"Just came back after saying 3 nights here. What can I say about this place? Firstly it's in a great location, safe and easy access to town. The room is tiny but as we only stayed in the room to sleep, I have no complaints. The shower room was small also ,but the shower was fantastic, powerful and hot. The breakfast was lovely and the place was clean. the staff were very helpful. Overall I really loved this place and will return here again. The only thing that stopped me rating this hotel the highest was that it need a coat of paint and new carpets but I have stayed in far more expensive hotels and which were not a patch on this place.","en"
"5",4,"Stayed in twin room 3312 in the annexe building. The room was blissfully quiet, clean and comfortable. The usual coffee and tea making facilities were available, and there was a decent sized desk / working area with an office-style chair as well as a small armchair. A proper hairdryer was located right next to a full length mirror which is always a bonus. In place of a wardrobe, there was a small area with enough metal hangers to store an ample amount of clothing. The stylish bathroom with walk in shower was spotless, and there was a pump dispenser for body wash within the shower and hand wash by the sink. No other toiletries were available, although a sign indicated you could ask for items at reception. Two vending machines near the reception area were available for basic snacks and drinks, plus a range of useful 'essential' items. A basic continental / cooked self-serve breakfast was included in the price and this was taken in a room with a very pleasant atrium design, which allowed natural light to flood in. The staff at reception and at breakfast were some of the most polite and courteous I've spoken too, and we had no problem leaving our luggage after check out, so that we could spend more time in London. The tube at West Kensington was just a 5 minute walk away, and buses 28 and 391 stopped right outside the hotel entrance.","en"
"6",4,"Not quite sure what the issue was with the executive lounge that one of the previous reviewers had, but we were delighted with the hotel. We stayed for a leisure break for two nights and found the hotel surpassed out expectations. The breakfast was particularly good, and with the exception of one member of staff at check-in, we found the staff to be friendly. On the negative side, an expensive £20 charge for early checkin - even though our room was ready. The room has a cooling system but is not true air conditioning and that was all the problems we had. Would definitely use again","en"
"7",4,"We stayed here for a long bank holiday. It's a great low price accommodation with a great location stayed in a studio which was very spacious. Only downside was we were on the road side and traffic was loud at times. Better glazing could sort this. All in all couldn't of got a better place for such a great price","en"
"8",4,"Never had such good service at a Travel Lodge. The staff were really good. Parking fees are very reasonable for the area. Close enough to Excel to walk and good value. Really can't find anything bad to say.","en"
"9",4,"My bf and l stayed at this hotel for one night yesterday as a belated Valentines treat (way cheaper than on 14th!), and we had an amazing stay. The hotel itself is very plush and with high end finishings, the staff at reception were most helpful and polite but not too stuffy. It's in a beautiful building that you don't really get to appreciate from the inside but still nice to view the court yard in the morning on our way to breakfast. The porter also gave us info about the place as he showed us to our room which was a nice touch. I booked through booking.com with a deal of a club room with breakfast, at check in we discovered we were able to go for free canapes and drinks in the club lounge which was a great added bonus. After a long travel from Brighton through heavy traffic it was just needed to relax with a glass of wine and some salmon sandwiches. The room itself was very lavishly decorated with a glass wall partitioning the bathroom off (blind use optional!), ipod docking station and a well stocked tea/coffee tray. For the price l was miffed that no water or light snacks were supplied free, only available from the mini bar, and a big disappointment was no bath robes. However, the bath was divine and big enough for two (tried and tested!), we refused the turn down service but happily received a card and a little tin of mints. As the hotel is pretty central to Old Street we found a little Thai place about 10 mins walk away for dinner before returning to make the most of the room. When we got back there was still some crockery in the hall near our room that l'd noticed there when we checked in, for a hotel of this quality l would of thought that should of been dealt with much quicker. The TV had a fairly poor quality screen but sufficed and the bed just made up for everything else - it felt like being enveloped in heaven. Both my partner and l had a fantastic sleep, had to drag ourselves out for the hot breakfast in the adjoining pub. Gave over our room number and there had been some mix up on the paperwork saying we could only have the hotel continental breakfast, however the waiter reassured my protests and sat us anyway, then went to check. All was well and we ordered Eggs Benedict that my bf couldn't stop raving about. Sampled the sausages, mushrooms, croissants and pain au chocolat from the buffet area, all of which were equally as delish. Overall l really enjoyed my stay at this hotel and would recommend it/go back myself but perhaps insist on robes and have time to check out the sauna/steam room in the wellness centre!","en"
"10",2,"I know a friend and I booked a cheapy package so I was not expecting any high standard or luxury, I knew it would be basic - but what I do expect is good manners, full cleanliness and a good degree of customer service. Where do I begin - we had to pay £20 deposit for a hairdryer and had to seek out the housekeeper in order to get one (don't try after 7pm at night or you have no chance). DO NOT speak to a concierge as they are no help, they sell you a map at £2 if you ask for directions, ask them anything else and they will answer with one word and will give the impression that you are encroaching upon their precious time - VERY RUDE!!! as for the room - The bedding stunk of sweat. The shower curtain was dirty and encrusted with dirt. If you want more than one cup of tea/coffee each forget it as that's all you are allowed. There is no temperature adjustment in the room, you are either hot or cold, so don't stay in the sumer as no air con!! If you wish to leave your luggage on the day of checkout , be warned you have to pay 50p per item which I feel is a rip off. Also the breakfast is a disgrace, cold and greasy food. Also the tables were scruffy and heaven help you if you ask someone to clean it as they will just scowl at you. Vending machines - out of order for 3 days we were there so take a drink/snacks with you - at least there is a shop across the road that is open. Location, excellent, and there is a tube station very close by and you can get the piccadilly line to most destinations. Overall I would not say do not go, but expect to get less than the basics and just be prepared. It is ok to get your head down for 1 or 2 nights but that is it. Do not ask questions as you will just get attitude back!! Premier Travel Inn is so much better if you want decent basics with good service.","en"
"11",4,"We were in London for a long weekend filled with wedding events. We booked (2) lofted apartments for 6 people. While there wasn't much closet space, it was comfortable for the long weekend, and if there were less people in the rooms, it would be okay for long-term stay as well. Clean and friendly staff, and they're great about storing the luggage if you get in too early or are leaving to the airport later than your check-out time. It's a busy hotel though, so I wouldn't expect a late check-out. The location is Kensington, which is always a good bet. Right down the street from the Natural History Museum, Victoria and Albert Museum, Kensington High Street (shopping!), Kensington Gardens, Hyde Park, and Albert Music Hall. It's a short tube ride away from everything else as well. There are also two Sainsbury's in the area, and I'd suggest grabbing a few late night snacks and drinks! It was a pleasant stay in one of our favorite neighborhoods.","en"
"12",5,"Stayed here last night excellent rooms lovely friendly staff always waiting to speak to you help you amazing service and thank you to girl who kindly helped me with printing of my boarding pass this morning, she was so patient always smiling. She was a special person.","en"
"13",3,"Had a first floor room with frosted windows, no view at all so don't be taken in by all the glitzy photos on the website. Constant noise from the lift machinery throughout the night. No blackout curtains, poor nights' sleep. Good breakfast but staff too eager to remove used crockery & cutlery the moment I has finished.","en"
"14",5,"Why would you pay top hotel prices when you can stay here? The beds are amazing and there is a choice of pillows, I had the best nights sleep ever. The windows cut out the London noise and there is air con. All the staff we met were very friendly and so helpful. The restaurant was great for our evening meal (we had lots of snacks instead of a full meal) service was very quick. Will most definitely come here again for all future London trips.","en"
"15",3,"The location is great, but VERY touristy. Don't plan to get around in a rush on the weekends or evenings....there are tourists everywhere! But if you are a tourist - the location is great. Bar in the hotel is fun and there is a ton in the area. I stayed due to status with SPG. Which I didn't realize, but SPG messed up my status and so check in was terrible. No upgrade, no wifi, and of course they wouldn't believe me at the front desk (I'm a returning guest - check the file). No instead, I have to call myself to the US, and yes, error, status reinstated, but only after an hour of hassle. And this was at 11pm after a 13 hour workday. Not happy. Next 3 days in a row my key wouldn't work, so I'd have to go to the front desk to have it reset. BUT they would make me wait until someone was free, which one night was 20 minutes. Again, this was late at night (I was working long days while over there). I wrote an email mid stay (I was there for 6 nights), to which no one responded :( Room service - girl on the phone didn't know much about the menu. I ordered a soup and salad. Soup was mushroom, wasn't very good. And the salad was supposed to be the special with a ginger dressing. It was so spicy I couldn't eat it. Why wouldn't you tell me it's spicy? Ginger dressing doesn't say spicy to me?? I completed the online review they sent me when I got home and the manager wrote back offering to personally assist on my next stay. Well, that will probably be next year and new people will be there by then and your email will be long lost. Very disappointed with W on this trip, and SPG. Shame to treat a repeat guest like this, will be tough to go back. Oh, and in case you didn't see my previous review - bring earplugs, it's very loud outside, so if you are a light sleeper they are needed - especially on the weekend!","en"
"16",5,"The hotel room is set up with any kind of high tech and state of the art contraptions. As soon as you walk into the room you notice the creative work of solving problems needed to be fixed. The really ancient window which looks like it's going to break any second if a bird touched it with its wing is therefore so dirty that you barely can look outside. Not a problem since the view outside is rather obstructed with an old and run-down balcony. Not to mention the modern way the window's incapability of closing and opening it was fixed by a subtle paper bag that cracks the window open a couple inches resisting extreme weather conditions and not letting in any warmth during night. The moldy, off-coming plaster on the ceiling was professionally fixed with sellotape and nicely re-designed by letting some of it dangling. The color of the gum stuck on the floor leading to the bathroom indicates a high number of guests it probably brought domestic bless and the last deep-cleaning was done before some of us were even born. First impression of the bathroom was quite okay. The in-built in the wall shower head is ultra-flexible due to its lacking attachment and some loose screws (I recommend wearing a helmet in the near future using this shower). No doubt this hotel plays a leading role in the fight of global warming and environment protection! For the fact there's no hot or even lukewarm water guests shower less frequently and most of all much shorter. Who needs warm water to shower?! For those of you who like to clean their feet once in a while this hotel holds a special invention for you in store. If you got too cold feet to take a shower there's water leaking from a little hole on the outside of the toilet accumulating in front of the sink. This 'Eau de Toilette' presents a perfect way of keeping your feet fresh and 'clean'. If you're planning on staying with company, I recommend using the night as an opportunity to talk about everything under the sun since you won't be getting any sleep in this rather uncomfortable bed ( I got better sleep by spending the night on the bare floor). Or it's because of the mold spread all over the room.","en"
"17",4,"Stayed for one night. Check in was friendly and efficient. Was upgraded to a junior suite which was lovely and spacious. Hotel decor was lovely and bedrooms really different to any other hotel I've stayed in. Let down was one hour wait we had for breakfast as they had mislaid our order!","en"
"18",3,"We were there for 3 nights over a weekend in May. For the price we paid for the room, this hotel was a good deal. The hotel is in a very convenient location to the Paddington underground station which is practically next door to the hotel. And the Paddington train station to catch the express train to Heathrow is next door to the underground station. We had no problems rolling our big suitcase and ourselves to the train station. The hotel is also surrounded by local neighborhood eateries if you find yourself hungry after a long day out like we did one night. The hotel and room were clean and had what we needed - but space was very tight. Not a deal breaker for us since we didn't spend much time in our room. The elevator was broken when we were there so that was a bit of a hassle when we checked in and checked out with our bags. But the hotel was very apologetic about it. The breakfast that's included was surprisingly generous. It's served at the restaurant next/in the hotel. The restaurant staff seemed overwhelmed so don't plan for a quick breakfast unless you skip the hot foods. We would consider staying here again.","en"
"19",2,"I had read the reviews before I booked and was expecting the worst but all I needed was a hotel near to Paddington station for one night. The room was small, basic and the decor was a bit shabby but it was clean and the bed was comfortable. There was a small wardrobe, television, hairdryer and you could make tea and coffee. The bathroom’s decor was also a bit shabby but was clean and the shower was fine although the hot water had to be run for a couple of minutes to warm up. The staff were friendly and helpful. I didn’t eat breakfast as I wanted something more substantial so I can not comment on it. If you intend spending a lot of time in your hotel room this isn’t the hotel I would choose but if all you need is a bed and shower for the night then for under £50 in central London this hotel is ok.","en"
"20",5,"Stayed for one night this week. Service was excellent especially in the Polo bar. Location is perfect and the breakfast is great. Our room was very comfortable and when there was a problem with the electrics we were moved straight away to another (bigger) room","en"
"21",1,"It's four thirty am of night four of a seven night stay in London and once again I am wide awake. I am dreading the thought of another night in this hotel. If I hadn't prepaid, I would have left after night one. The rooms are not air conditioned and the constant noise thrum and whine of the lobby aircon, right below the window, is driving me mad. I thought about asking for a quieter room but I don't trust this hotel anymore and they'll probably move me somewhere worse. I'm never staying in an Ibis hotel again. My suggestion is that you stay somewhere else.","en"
"22",5,"Excellent hotel with very spacious rooms for London. Rooms are well equipped with everything one needs (iron, hairdryer, mini-bar, coffee/tea facilities, ...) Nice and friendly staff. Cosy ambiance in the bar and restaurants. Definitely a place to return to.","en"
"23",2,"This was my first experience for the latest London hotel euphemism for a really small room - a cabin. It was advertised as such and, with breakfast included, was a reasonable price (for London) at £75. The location is good - just 2 minutes walk from Goodge Street underground and very handy for the centre of London. The staff were friendly and helpful and the breakfast room was clean and the meal enjoyable with fast attentive service - but I was the first in and it might get a bit tighter for space later. Also a 7:30 start is a bit late for some of us business users. The public areas of the hotel appeared clean but a refurb wouldn't go amiss. The bedroom itself was the smallest I have been in with half of the single bed fitting exactly into a small alcove - the bed itself was quite comfortable. There is no chair, no rubbish bin, no kettle, no drinking glass or air conditioning provided. Bizarrely a thermos flask was placed by the bed but was half filled with cold water - strange! There was no plug in the sink and the pedestal for the wash basin protrudes in front of the toilet so you have to sit almost sideways! There was mould around the ceiling of the shower room and no air-conditioning. When the very small window was opened it let in a large amount of street noise. There was no bedside light switch. To turn out the bedroom light one has to go outside the bedroom door! For those with limited movement there are a lot of small windy stairs and no lift.","en"
"24",5,"very close to the tube (Northern line) and a variety of bus routes with lots of shops and restaurants close by. Easy access to a cinema, Sadlers Wells Theatre and Exmouth Market. Very tranquil setting - slightly difficult to find, but worth the effort!","en"
"25",4,"Great hotel, great staff. Good food. Huge room (room 3) with couch and two double beds not that I needed it as I was travelling solo. The room was booked by a company I was lecturing for and I think they paid £150 a night as they have an account with the hotel. I thought that this was good value for money.","en"
"26",5,"My wife and I stayed at the Double tree after getting a good deal on Agoda. We were impressed on it's location, a stones throw from Tower Hill underground station (2-4mins max walk) and views of Tower Bridge and The Tower of London, depending on room. A quiet area of town on the weekends which makes it nice to get away from the crowds of Trafalgar Sq and Oxford street areas. The welcome and staff on reception were friendly and were always there if you had any problems. The rooms were clean and spacious and better still had free wi-fi and a computer (iMac) for your use, which doubled up as TV and DVD player. Being a mac-addict this made the room awesome! The complimentary mini-bar (not available in all rooms I believe) had a nice selection though you do need to ask if you want more than what was in there. Would definitely use the hotel again if I can get a similar deal.","en"
"27",4,"a small cute hotel. Very good reach brakefast. Wi-Fi worked most of the time. a clean place with hot waters in the shower. Close to paddington station just a 5 minutes walk. Just a great place. Only problem was that there just weren't enough AC plugs in the room. We personally have lived on the 4th floor without an elevator so just take that into acount.","en"
"28",5,"I don't recommend this hotel. Even if we booked a deluxe room, the room is very too small, no bathroom only a very small shower room, you can't be 2 people in the this shower room even with a child, (as I was with my daughter). The beds are too small even if we are small in stature.. and the mattress too old... unacceptable. And when it is breakfast time, you have to wait more than 15 min and do the queue before having a table, as ""guests"" from outside can have breakfast also and you do not have any priority. Breakfast buffet was empty... Again unacceptable. The best advice: don't go ! First time and last time for us.","en"
"29",5,"I was upgraded to an executive suite for the week and while small, the room was very comfortable. The suite section is across from the main hotel and is located on multiple floors, but through multiple buildings, which can get a bit confusing! Shower and amenities were quality, loved having a tea maker and biscuits daily. Very convenient to Paddington station -- just a 10 minute walk. Many small convenience stores for breakfast and lunch fare.","en"
"30",3,"We arrived after having booked on late rooms.com some 3 months previously. I received an email from late rooms the day before confirming our booking. When we arrived at the hotel and they had no record of our booking (even though I had rung and booked a parking space weeks before and confirmed the day before). The receptionist spent ages checking the computer and files of paperwork for our booking for about 10 minutes until I asked if they even had rooms for that night. Luckily they had and honoured the original price quoted. Then I enquiries as to where I would park I was told that I would have to squeeze my car on the end of the road. There was no was I could fit my small hatchback in that space so went back in and was informed we would have to go to a nearby church and use their parking facilities. Luckily they had room but it cost us £30 for 24hours, double the cost at the hotel. We were given directions to our room and upon entry were pleasantly surprised by it. Average size room but it had plenty of storage, lovely big bathroom with a huge modern walk in shower with rainfall head. Comfortable beds with plenty of bedding. My only qualms with the room were no double glazing and the hotel is on a busy road, and also no milk just whitener for hot drinks. Minor things which didn't effect our stay too much! Breakfast was a bit on the basic side with cheap ingredients reheated to order. The staff were very friendly though. To conclude then, an average experience but I would stay here again and it was cheap compared to other hotels in the area and only 5 minute walk to Paddington Station which meant 20mins to Central London.","en"
"31",5,"The staff were so helpful and friendly, talkative without being over-friendly - very well judged. The room was lovely, with a firm but comfortable bed, and a clean well-equipped bathroom. Good to have free water/coffee in the lounge, although we missed being able to make drinks in the room. The location was perfect for us, and surprisingly quiet at night. I like the way that the renovations preserve the original features of this Victorian building - I personally would like a bit more information about the history of the building and the area (I discovered for myself that the name comes from the Gore Estate). Breakfast was superb - several choices of muesli (including gluten-free), lots of fresh fruit and freshly-squeezed juices. When we checked out it was raining very hard - the girl on the desk kindly lent us an umbrella so that we could walk out to meet friends.","en"
"32",4,"We had booked this hotel as we had tickets to see a band on the Saturday night at the O2 arena. It was a decent price (£75 approx) and included free parking and breakfast. Room was more than adequate, very clean with a decent loo / shower. All staff we met were friendly & helpful. Secure parking was available behind the hotel with an automatic gate - so we were happy to leave the car. 10 min walk to the tube station and then 15 mins on the tube straight to the O2. Area felt very safe to walk around - although on the Saturday night (at around midnight / 1 am) we got a taxi from the station back to the hotel which cost £6 - I'm sure it would have been fine to walk though. Breakfast was fine - not spectacular, but good coffee, loads of toast / cereal available etc. Staff were also happy for us to leave the car there for most of the Sunday as we went off sightseeing (Kew Gardens). We only collected the car at about 6pm on the Sunday, even though we had checked out on the Sunday morning. Really can't complain - very well priced clean and friendly hotel in a great location. Would def use again.","en"
"33",5,"Haven't stayed in a Premier Inn before, but if they're all this good I'd be pleasantly suprised. Very friendly staff, spotlessly clean rooms, brand new bathrooms. The location is perfect for any City business or sightseeing around the Tower and Bridge. As my husband said 'it is what it is, and it's very good at it!' Only thing I would say is I wish we'd stayed in the hotel to eat. Obviously there's not much in the vicinity that's open on the weekend and we ended up having some pretty atrocious meals in either the wetherspoons across the way or the other pub up the road, The Minories. It was marathon weekend, so it may be this isn't indicative of the food usually. Based on the great breakfasts we had in the hotel, I would much rather have stayed in and eaten!","en"
"34",5,"My husband and I stayed at The Capital the last week in November, 2012. We usually go to London every November and have walked past The Capital many times and finally decided to stay there. It was a wonderful experience. The room was a classic room, small but very cozy and comfortable. The staff at The Capital are really what made our visit so much more enjoyable - efficient, helpful, friendly. The breakfast had a great selection. We ate dinner in the restaurant, Outlaw's, and it was a great dining experience as well. Once again the food and the service were good. This will be our hotel of choice from now on.","en"
"35",4,"My brother and I spent several days in London and were pleased with this hotel. It is not far from the Tower of London and the Tower Hill station, though can be a little hard to find. The twin room was small but clean and quiet. The staff were very professional -- knowledgeable, courteous and helpful. We were able to take advantage of discounted prices that resulted in the rates being quite reasonable. BNased upon our experience, I would definitely stay at a Premier Inn again.","en"
"36",5,"I thoroughly enjoyed my recent stay at this iconic London hotel. Normally I stay at the Ritz in Piccadilly, but friends suggested that I needed to try something different to broaden my London experience. I had watched the wonderful documentary series Inside Claridges previously and felt that the hotel would be a good fit, what with my love of Art Deco and penchant for history. To ensure that I made the most of my stay I conducted considerable research on the hotel. This included learning about potential pitfalls of individual rooms on this site and reading countless reviews across the net. I then made a number of requests to the reservations' team upon booking. On arrival I was greeted by one of the managers who escorted me to check in and completed all the necessary procedures. I was offered a tour of the hotel which I really appreciated since it was my first visit. This really helped me to get a sense of where things were for my four night stay. Not all hotel staff will do this, but at Claridges staff never hesitated to offer their assistance and often anticipated when assistance was needed. One morning as I exited the hotel doors I looked up to see clouds gathering. The doorman, noticing this, instinctively offered me an umbrella. It was a good quality umbrella too - not always something found even at top hotels. It came in very handy that day too! I booked a deluxe room for a four night stay. After being escorted to my room I was given a tour of all the amenities, including how to operate the Japanese toilet in the bathroom. The room was renovated and very clean. Just as I had requested at booking, a book about the hotel's history was positioned on the bed in Claridges ribbon. The room had also been set to the requested temperature. A true measure of good service, I was asked by the manager before he left whether I was satisfied with the room and if not, whether I wanted to see some alternatives. With everything so perfectly arranged as desired, I did not need to see anything else. The room was very spacious, with a decent sized walk in wardrobe. The bathroom had a separate shower and soaking tub, which filled up quite quickly (I normally eschew baths because they take so long to fill). The chairs were comfortable and the electronics were all contemporary and in fine working order. I really couldn't have asked for more. I made use of the in room dining and had breakfast in the lobby one morning. The food was excellent. Usually hotels don't do food very well, but the chefs at Claridges are true craftsmen. I highly recommend their chicken pot pie - it was one of the best meals I have ever had! It was also wonderful to find a hotel that makes an excellent cappacino outside of Italy and Australia. While I had every intention of using the gym, I never got around to it since I walked a lot about London. That said, there was always a row of taxis outside the hotel and Bond Street tube station was a very short walk away. On coming and going from the hotel, staff always said hello. I was impressed when I came across the manager who checked me in and he remembered my name several days' later when I ran into him in the lobby. Had I been travelling with people I would certainly have tried the bars at the hotel. They are very beautiful places. Every part of the hotel was charming and judging by the work teams in various locations during my stay (always discreet), Claridges is always being kept up to standard. I can only imagine the difficulties in maintaining such a grand old building! So credit to the maintenance staff for their professionalism and fine work. If there was one thing that stood out for me as an ultimate point during my stay it would have to be the amazing scent that wafts through the grand lobby. I can still smell it in my mind as I write. There is something comforting about it - walking into the hotel I was completely removed from the hustle and bustle of London outside. It's a wonderful feeling. I will definitely be returning to Claridges in the future. I do love the Ritz, but I love Claridges more. It lives up to its hype, which is so rare in the hotel industry. Yes, it is expensive, but you do get what you pay for - at least I think so. While the building and it's rooms are exquisite, it is ultimately the staff who give Claridges it's five stars. Thank you to those seen and unseen who made my short London stay a very memorable one.","en"

"38",5,"We have stayed here 3 times now and again were not disappointed on our last stay at the weekend. We had a room over looking the middle of the hotel so not a great view but it was quite apart for the air-con units which you do get used to. It is a dated hotel but very nice, we choose not to include breakfast because of the amount of local cafes offering a great breakfast choice at very reasonable prices. A 5 minute walk and you are on Oxford Street and 5 minutes later in Soho,Theatre Land and China Town. Everything you need is almost on the door step it is also only a 15minute walk from Euston or Goodge Street Underground station is just around the corner. There is also a massive array of Restaurants within 250 yard radius of the hotel I guess you could eat every day for a year at a different restaurant.","en"
"39",5,"Well, what can you say about a 5* hotel in London that what could be expected! It was very comfortable, luxourious and everything was of highest standards. The staff were welcoming, pleasant and helpful and the room was well made up, clean and very comfortable. We didn't partake in the spa facilities but they looked great, or didn't have the breakfast. It was £15/person which I couldn't justify when there's a JD Wetherspoon next door which did an excellent Eggs Benedict & Coffee for £4.59!! Stayed here though a last minute deal, and was a wonderful stay!","en"

"43",5,"Booked this hotel for my husbands birthday. Called & spoke to David who was extremely helpful & advised me to complete my booking online as there was an offer to sign up for Free breakfast, which I did. I then called David back to arrange a room in a quite location(found this tip on here under room tips) & mentioned it was for my husband birthday & he offered me the choice of a complimentary bottle of wine or cake, nice touch. When we arrived to check in, which was around 11.30am we were told our room was actually ready. Well what can I say, room 213 was perfect. Albeit over looking a chimney which had scaffolding round it but most importantly very quite & to be far that didn't bother us as we were in London. As I had booked an executive room we had access to the executive lounge which was just round the cornor from our room. We popped in for some coffee & danishes before heading out for the day. Complimentry happy hour was from 5pm to 9pm so we called in for a few drinks & canapés before heading out for the evening. Next day we went downstairs for full English breakfast, there was plenty of choice & the food was good. You could have had a continental breakfast in the executive lounge if you wanted to. Had a lovely day in London as the weather was dry. In the evening we went to see Wicked which was brilliant! Used the rear door from Victoria Train station which was very handy. Lovely traditional hotel with lots of character, which has been renovated to a high standard, we would definitely stay here again. Thank you for the bottle of wine & a very enjoyable stay.","en"

When we arrived at the hotel the receptionist from the desk told us that we were upgraded to a Club room !! . ' After we entered the room we were very impressed... Monica left a nice card on the bed for us and complimentary whine , fruits, flowers and chocolates and more then that! a late check out till 1.00pm was allowed by the duty manager Gahan. our last request was to leave the luggage at reception and Gahan allowed again to store our bags till late in the evening ;0 The room was nice and clean facing the street , quiet in the night.

"47",4,"Great location, not even 5 min walk from Kings Cross Station. At the bottom of a quiet street. Reception and check in was easy, was nice and clean/tidy in the reception area. A corridor with 5 seperate stairs dotted along the long corridor take you to different rooms. I was at the end using stairs 'E' the stairs are narrow and there is no lifts. If you have large baggage I'm sure you could ask for a room on the ground floor. I was on the second floor in a 'Small Double' the room was small as expected but cosy and clean. The bathroom was pretty tiny, the toilet is nearly in the shower. If you was wanting more space I would book a large room. But I had no issues and slept really well. The bed was very comfy with plenty of pillows. The room was a bit warm so I did have the window open, there wasn't really any street noise to keep me awake. The free wifi worked well for me. I would stay here again.","en"

We made the reservation trough agoda.com and specially requested to have an upper floor with street view. On arrival the rude woman from reception gave us a room in the basement which made us really angry so we had to complain to agoda who contacted the hotel and made sure the next day we will have an upper floor room. The basement rooms shouldn't even exist as they look like u're in the prison, very small and no sunlight, dirty and damp. I will be back with update tomorrow whether we will get the promissed room or not....","en"

"50",4,"We recently made a trip to London with 6 kids and stayed here...it was absolutely wonderful...perfect location, the staff were all extremely friendly and helpful...I didnt meet one hotel employee in the hallway who didnt speak and smile. It was a GREAT experience for our first time in London. We had 4 rooms and every single one of us felt like we had enough room and our rooms were nice...my husband had stayed in London earlier in the year and had a terrible experience and a room the size of a small closet. I know there are derogatory comments on here about this hotel...but take it from me, dont listen to them...I have stayed in Ritz Carltons, Westins, etc. and I was very happy here. Again, the location was perfect for seeing all the sights of London!! If you want a nice place, a good location and a caring staff, this is the place for you...I was so worried because of some of the reviews on here, but it turned out so great...I'm thinking these people had a terrible personal experience because THEY made it one!! Enjoy your trip and STAY HERE, YOU WONT BE SORRY!!","en"

"52",5,"We stayed here 4 nights. Staff is very pleasant and helpful. On our arrival and departure day we were able to leave our luggage in the hotel before check-in and after check-out. The room was very cosy and clean. However, space for personal toiletries in the bathroom is rather small. I was a bit afraid that it will be cold in the room, but that was not the case. We enjoyed very much the fact that we can prepare our morning coffee and tea in the room. Hotel is on a great location - quiet street, 2-3 minutes walk to the Earl's Court Underground, bus stop is also near. If you don't mind walking, in about 15 minutes you can reach Science Musem, Natural History Museum or Victoria and Albert Museum. I really enjoyed staying in this hotel and would choose it again.","en"

"56",3,"Set in busy Central London I was never expecting a quiet night's sleep. We were offered rooms on the 3rd floor which despite having no lift access were actually quite quiet though. The reception was quick, friendly, and helpful - even late in the evening when we required assistance with a room key. The room was reasonably sized for a relatively cheaply priced London hotel. The bathroom was clean although the shower temperature fluctuated. The hotel is within walking distance of several tube stations, banks with ATMs, and convenience stores.","en"

A nice buffet breakfast is included in the room price and this is served on the 12th floor with great views of London. We look forward to staying here again when next in London.","en"
"58",5,"After two weeks on the continent we went for a spurge at this, what appears to be a primarly business hotel, modern property. Great decision. London is without a doubt a horribly expensive city, and hotels are part of that expense. If you are a tourist, you can easily get over having all the suits around; no one seemed to care we dressed casual for travel. Room was spacious, clean, bright, great view. Lounge was nice; restaurant was also nice, but breakfast didn't seem to be a good value. Guest services staff was excellent. Checked out DVD's, borrowed umbrellas, received great directions. The hotel is actually convenient to tube stops and is only a ten or so minute pleasant walk to Westminster Abby.","en"
"59",5,"A first class top ranked hotel, bordering Trafalgar Square right in the centre of London's downtown action; and, close to any and all amenities imaginable and near Canada House. As a retired Professor of Les Roches Marbella International School of Hotel Management, I much appreciated the courtesy upgrade. The staff was courteous and efficient. Finding underground parking nearby turned in to quite a challenge, albeit it proved only a mere 5 minute walk to the hotel.","en"
"60",3,"Nice area in an upscale neighborhood. Freddy Mercury's house is right behind. Earl's Court tube station an easy walk. Bus stop just down the street. Good selection of restaurants and pubs a short walk away. My favorite was The Hansome Cab on Ear's Court Road. 5 minutes away. Hotel is a modest, by London standards, ""economy"". The staff is great. Friendly, courteous, and helpful. Rooms are efficient. No phones in the room, but reception help you. Wifi available at 3 pounds per day. No wash cloths, which I thought strange. The maid told me they don't have any when I asked for some. Nice bar area, and the restaurant is actually quite good and modestly priced. I would stay again.","en"
"61",3,"I stayed here as I needed to be within 2 minutes of the south bank at unsociable hours for a work event. A warm welcome but lengthy checkout process complete I was pleased to find a largw, clean room. The rooms are budget hotel standard basic, but complete with hairdryer, tea and coffee making facilities etc. My stay was marred by problems with plumbing that meant to hot water. I did however complain and they were very prompt and fair at acknowledging the issue. All in all, this is a great location and if you're looking for somewhere central, at a reasonable price for London and are not planning to spend a lot of time in your room, you will probably find this a good choice. Kuddos to Premier Inn for having a solid customer service team.","en"
"62",3,"We've just returned from and overnight at the Millennium Gloucester Hotel London, first appearances were very pleasing but I'm afraid it the stay wasn't without fault. On a positive note, the room was clean as was the rest of the hotel, staff were friendly, and a nice but pricey bar and restaurant - but then it is central London. Negatives were, Room Air con didn't work which meant we had to open a window for the night, VERY NOISY all night!! No plug for the sink....a minor point I know but a real pain when trying to wash!! They tried to invoice us for a bar charge when we didn't even use the bar?? All in all an OK stay but they really should do much better for the money they charge. TIP! Food is much much cheaper in the Casino next door as were the drink prices.....much better value and free entrance!!","en"

"69",4,"Just come home from a weekend relaxing trip to london, with 12 year old son. Husband booked the Andaz, as stays regularly through work. I found it to be very masculine, practical but a little basic. I felt disappointed that there was no pampering or great luxury. There was nothing to complain about, it just did not feel like a five star experience. It is a shame, but four star hotels such as the Cavendish, the chesterfield, and park plaza riverside seem to have given a better experience for less money. I don't know if I would stay there again?","en"
"70",3,"I stayed for one night in the Hazlitts hotel with my fiance in May, and found it to be incredibly dissapointing. Im only twenty years old, and wouldnt normally spend this much on a hotel, but it was a special occasion as my fiance was flying out to Peru the next day, and we decided to splash out. I spent alot of time researching different hotels, and finally settled on the Hazlitss because of the style and character that it appeared to have. I have to say that the hotel did have a huge amount of character, but unfortunatly the positives stop there. On entering our room we found it to be alot smaller than we expected, and there was an overwhelming smell of cleaning products. One thing that the website boasts about is the luxury REN toiletries, this i have to say is a joke. the toiletries supplied were beyond minimal, there were three miniscule bottles; one containing shampoo and two soap. There wasnt enough for both me and my partner to wash our hair that evening. Maybe i sound like im being picky....but with the amount that it costs to stay the night here, i expected a little more attention to detail. Other than that, we were given a room on the front, which meant we were kept awake until the early hours of the morning. The noise from the street we expected...after all this is a price you pay when u stay in central London, right? What we didnt appreciate was the noise coming from the other rooms, could the walls be any thinner? Just to add, the air conditioning didnt work, the fire alarm went off at 4am for no reason, and there a was a large amount of building work happening to the Hotel, that we werent aware of before we arrived. If i had of known this, i would have booked somewhere else. Dont get me wrong, i do think this is a nice hotel, actually i think its lovely...but its not even close to the being value for your money. This hotel rests on the fact that it is historic and has alot of character...dont expect anything else. I was very deflated after i left, i kind of feel like ive been cheated from my money. I have also made numerous attempts to contact the hotel about my views....which have all been ignored. I guess they dont like critism. my advice is this, if u have lots of money to throw away, then this hotel is lovely for a casual night in London. But if you have saved up, or though want somewhere really special....dont choose this hotel.","en"

"73",5,"We booked this hotel on-line and chose two One Bedroom Suites, some 8 months in advance, the package was with Expedia and the value was exceptional. Greeting on arrival was attentive and friendly. Our car was valet overnight at a rate of £14.00, which I considered a bargain for the location in London, we were attending the Mark Knopfler concert at the O2, and the hotel location was perfect. The hotel laid on private hire transfers to and from the O2 at £18.00 each way, also good value and executive cars. Reception was easy and friendly and the rooms were extremely well equipped with TV's in all rooms, Bose sound system, fast WiFi, once you chose the correct band. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom huge and well equipped. Highly recommended if your thinking of attending the O2, or using as a base for London. Checking out was equally easy and attentive, and my car was returned within minutes. Great Experience ,","en"

Location great for Victoria and getting about . For the price I cannot believe the Reviews on this Hotel ,If I had paid for the Goring or The Dorchester and ended up at the Sidney Hotel Id be furious but I didn't. Value money makes this a 5 star Review .","en"

"77",5,"We always visit London in early December and have always stayed in 4 star hotels but the prices this year for a hotel in a good location are prohibitive. This is the first time we have stayed in a Travelodge and what a pleasant surprise. The hotel is is in a fantastic location only 5 minutes walk from Holborh underground station and a few minutes walk from Covent Garden and theatre land. The hotel supplied all our needs, the staff were pleasant and helpful. The all you can eat breakfast at £7.95 was tremendous value for money and was well presented and cooked. The early check in and the late check out at £10 each way is well worth while as the hotel cannot store cases. We will definitely return next year and recommend it to our friends","en"
"78",1,"We booked 2 nights here for the bank holiday weekend. This was our first time in london and we thought this place would be ideal for our base. The hotel staff were helpfull all of the time and the cleanliness of the place could not be faulted. However the size of the room left us feeling claustraphobic. This was so small it was a struggle to move around and impossible to relax. You can literally touch all four walls whilst sat on the bathroom toilet. The prices at the restaurant and bar are a bit steep, at £20 for an english breakfast we thought it best to eat out all of the time. The hotel parking is expensive too at £40 a night on top of the standard room rate, made for a pricey stay. We thought that being on sloane street it would have bars and restaurants located near by, but unfortunately the nearest nightlife is a tube ride away. Although there are designer clothes shops near it is like a ghost town in this part of london, and you would be better off staying elsewhere.","en"

"80",4,"Enjoyed a pleasant 3 day break at the Doubletree. Twin deluxe room was very clean and spacious. Bathroom was spotless. Only criticism I have is that my room was at the rear of the hotel next to the outside air conditioning duct which prevented us from opening the window to allow some fresh air into the room which made it difficult to get to sleep atnight.","en"
"81",3,"First off, the staff were really friendly and helpful, could not fault them at all. We were delighted to hear upon our arrival that our room had been upgraded to a Club Room. Nice, until we saw the room that is! To be fair, the room was moderately clean, though I could not help but notice the dust on the bizarre 70's style wood panelled walls. It feels like a room from a very dated bond movie where you have ""hidden"" wardrobes in the walls (which you could hardly hang anything in) and a hidden desk, you push a panel and out it pops. That might have been a nice space saving touch if they hadn't also included a full size desk in the room which is in the way of one of the ""hidden"" wardrobes. The hidden wardrobes are also completely unnecessary, given that they also have a full size wardrobe in the room- how many wardrobes does a room need? The curtains in the room were of a horrible shade of pink velvet I have only ever seen in run-down secondary schools and old people's homes, did not go with the wood panelling at all. This brings me on to the windows - only single glazed which meant we could hear every car door slam and every clatter of heels on the pavement outside when we were actually trying to sleep. Not ideal. Neither was the bed, a very uncomfortable mattress, one very thin pillow and one very lumpy one. I dare say that if we had been staying for more than one night we would have requested a change of pillows but for only the one night, we didn't bother. Another thing I disliked about the room was the lighting, very harsh bright lighting, felt more like an office environment, rather than a cosy comfortable hotel room. Probably what I liked the most about the room was the bathroom, it had a very nice shower. We had a cooked breakfast in the hotel restaurant in the morning which is buffet style, the bacon and scrambled eggs were cold and the coffee was burned. As the staff were very friendly and helpful, I am certain that they would have rectified this had we bothered to complain at the time. Unfortunately, we had a train to catch and simply didn't have the time. Pros: Friendly staff, nice shower, Free wifi Cons: Terrible decor, poor sound insulation, uncomfortable bed, disappointing breakfast","en"
"82",2,"My wife and I stay here once a year as part of a company dinner. It is certainly one of the most expensive places I have ever stayed and we've travelled the globe. We don't mind paying good money but this may be London but it's excessive. In our room there was once again no tea or coffee facilities. If you would like some it's available from room service at £5.50. Water is £5 for a 75cl bottle. Some of the other reviews give you a flavour of the room service costs. The bar is no cheaper. The hotel clearly makes a great deal of money. Even if you are a resident the bar closes at 1am - prompt! No discussion. Mind you at the prices they charge it probably a bonus once you wake up in the morning. With the english breakfast buffet at £23.50 per person I personally think it's overrated, too expensive and not actually that good. A friend recommends the breakfast at the Halkin as one of the best in London. Service was fine and the room clean. No broadband link or wireless connection for the PC which isn't great for a so called 5 star. So, if you feeling flush and don't mind how you spend your money then this place is probably okay for you. There are much better ways of spending your money than staying here. Each to their own.","en"
"83",5,"I arrived in London at 9am, too early to check in, so they gladly took my bags and asked if there was anything I needed. I never pass up an opportunity to at least ask for an upgrade and they said they would make note (booking a basic room at 450.00 (US) a night). I arrived back at 10:30pm and checked in. They said they got my note for an upgrade and moved us into a Park Suite (goes for 6,000 US a night). Our bags were already in the room. What a room! Living room, dining room, dressing room, two bathrooms and a master bedroom. We got lost several times trying to find each other during our trip. Breakfast was delicious and on par for the Four Seasons. The patio outside was nice outside in the morning with the heaters. The bar was fun with unique drinks to choose from. I have stayed in the nicest Hotels in Paris, New York and Las Vegas, this hotel exceeded my expectations set by these other hotels and was the best hotel experience I have had, not only because of the upgrade, but because of the service of every staff member I ran into. I will go back everytime I am in London.","en"

"85",3,"After a late evening arrival into Paddington station, the hotel was a breeze to find and staff friendly and welcoming.

"86",4,"Booked 2 suites in this hotel for 4 adults and 4 children. We were not disappointed. The rooms were modern and well appointed. Those more accustomed to hotels in the US may find the rooms small, but are generous by London standards. The bedding is good and the showers are excellent. The decor, tres chic. The location is excellent. Being a 2 minute walk from Gloucester Road tube station means access to the Picadilly and Circle/District lines on the underground. Staff are friendly and more than willing to go above and beyond to help with your needs. Just a couple of things that potential guests need to be aware of: 1) this is not a pushchair (pram) friendly hotel. There are steps to navigate and doors you need to find a way of opening if you're by yourself. 2) there is no parking (or stopping) in front of the hotel so be prepared to lug your luggage from the adjacent streets.","en"

"91",3,"I'm left in two minds about this hotel so will try to be as fair and constructive as possible. First off, This is not a four star hotel. The standard and service level of the staff certainly is! But the hotel building, facilties and rooms are certainly not. We arrived to the Kensington Close Hotel on Tuesday last week and were very impressed with the first impression we got. The fabulous reception and lounge areas leaving right back to what looked to be a lovely and somewhat large, restaurant. When I got to my room however, the fairytale ended. I have stayed in nicer University Halls than the hotel room I was allocated on arrival. The bed wasn't even properly made and duvet was full of lumps. The bathroom long but ridiculously thin and I banged my head on the bathroom cabinet above the sink while brushing my teeth as well as getting water allo over the floor while washing my hands. Why, because the sink was so small I couldn't get my hands in it. Add to this the chargeable wifi at £9.95 per day which regularly can't connect to the router, probably due to this very large hotel and volume of users at one time. Not a 4 star service. £8 per day for use of the leisure facilities, which I appreciate is implemented as a way of restricting the volume of users to the size of the hotel, but still not a 4 star service. When I awoke on the first morning of three I was less than happy to say the least. Add to that my experience when I went down for breakfast to find my room number wasn't on the list. It was easy to see I wasn't the only one either. I was also refused fresh milk from the kitchen which anyone who has read my other revues is a bug bear of mine. In a 4 star hotel however, to be refused this upon request is unthinkable! The rest of the breakfast was very good but not worth £15 per person per day. After my event that day I went to speak to the Front of House manager, who was a lovely lady and very appreciative of my comments, even the bad ones. I was upgraded to an executive double room, which I still do not class as a 4 star but was certainly miles better than the first. The bed was comfortable though there was an obvious dip where the two mattresses met in the middle (zip linked beds). The bathroom was much better than the first and the sink was big enough to use normally. The rest of the stay was actually quite enjoyable. I chose not to use the leisure facilities as these wre chargable but would have used them if they were included in the room rate like a normal 4 star hotel. Sound proofing is the mahjor issue in this hotel. You can hear everything happening outside the bedroom door and through the paper thin walls. After I left the hotel I realised I had left my memory sticks in the room, which are in the process of being returned to me. As I said and please do let me be properly understood. The staff in this hotel are terrific, and do go out of their way to give great service. But they are up against the tide in this hotel when having to deal with all of the complaints caused by the standard of the physical hotel. Overall I believe this venue to be a 4 star conferencing facility as this is where the obvious investment has been made, with the standard of the bedrooms as an afterthought. Investment is obviously being made in the bedrooms but I still don't think the new rooms are up to the standard of a 4 star hotel. Maybe a 3 star, but even then you wouldn;t pay for half of the services that you will find chargeable in the Kengsington Close Hotel. Sad to say I won't return to this hotel. Which is a shame as the staff are all very good indeed. Please get teh standard of the bedrooms up to meet the standard of your staff. It's only fair.","en"
"92",4,"I was on a two day solo trip to London and decided to visit museums and shop. The Beaufort is situated two blocks from Harrod's and walking distance to two museums. The Victoria and Albert was closest and just a bit further was The Natural History Museum. The doorman and desk staff were very helpful and made me feel welcome. Shortly after checking in I had a delicious tea delivered to my room. The scones were some of the best I've had. My room was small by American standards but it was comfortable. There was sun spilling in the window, such a lovely sight in the chill of March. The Knightbridge tube stop is near if you want to see more of the city. They offered 24 hour coffee or tea room service which I took advantage of. Each time there was a rose on the tray. The Beaufort also offers cocktails in the evenings. I felt pampered while staying here. It's a great place to stay during a solo or couples trip.","en"
"93",5,"This was the second time we stayed at Sofitel St James. The first was in September 2011. We had a luxury 2 bed room at the 5th floor. The room was exceptionally clean and tidy. The beds were very conformable and we slept like we never slept before. Toiletries from Hermés were restocked when needed to be. Bathroom was large and beautiful in black and white Art Deco. Roberto greeted us every day in the dining room at breakfast with a smile and same friendly remarks. Lots of staff during breakfast made us feel pampered and well taken care of, and everyone noticed you and made you feel welcome. We felt that all staff working at Sofitel St James were proud of their job and did the outermost to make us feel welcome and important. This is what Luxury Hotels should be like, and we would love to come back many times.","en"
"94",5,"Just got back from staying at the Royal Lancaster, and we had a great time. I picked this hotel due to it's location (close to Paddington Tube) rather than any other reason. We were staying for my husbands 40th birthday, when we arrived, we were told that we had been upgraded to an executive room on the 16th floor, which had great views of London and Hyde Park. On arrival to the room, we found a birthday cake, balloons as well as a letter wishing my husband a happy birthday, a really nice touch which made his day even more special. I would recommend staying at this hotel for anyone wanting a trip to London. Although Lancaster Gate tube was seconds away from the hotel, Paddington station was less than 5 minutes walk from the hotel. A great location to get around. The prices were reasonable for London, and the service was the best I have experienced in the city. I have to agree that the exterior of the building may not be the most eye pleasing, but don't be put off, the interior more than makes up for it.","en"

"96",5,"I love this hotel! I travel the world and have stayed at many places, and the Langham is one that I return to over and over. It feels like coming home. The staff are so professional. They always remember me and go above and beyond to accommodate any request and remember many details about me that make my stay special and individualized. It is a true treat every time I stay here. The Club Lounge is a good deal as you can enjoy high tea, a full breakfast and snacks throughout the day. But definitely spend some time at the Artesian bar. Alex, Simone and Roman are amazing! Order off the menu, as there are so many unique creations, or just tell the bartender your mood and have them create something special for you. This is more than a top-class hotel. It's like staying with family.","en"

Bathroom was very small and unable to shut the door as handle was broken. We reported the problem and it was fixed the following day however. Towels were not replaced daily, just rehung in the bathroom. Only a choice of 2 TV channels with poor reception Breakfast was basic no fresh fruit and saucers instead of plates. Would not stay here again","en"

If you are going to Wembley Stadium this hotel is a very good option.","en"
"100",5,"Every few years I go back and re-read Ms. Mitford's hilarious books that so beautifully describe life in England between the wars. The Ritz was very much a part of aristocratic life at the time and so, when we planned our trip to London this spring, I checked to see if a stay at this legendary hotel was possible for us. I found a fabulous rate online and plans were made that did not disappoint. If you are a lover of traditional luxury and extraordinary service, give this old-world hotel a chance. The front desk upgraded us to a lovely room (with fireplace, small sitting area and beautiful bathroom), concierge got us fabulous seats at two terrific productions, we had some fun times at the Rivoli Bar and each time we walked into the hotel lobby one of the staff members greeted us by name. The location is fantastic - just across Green Park from Buckingham Palace and steps away from every luxury named store in the world. And, because of a strictly enforced dress code, we did not have to share our vacation with people attired for a hike in Idaho rather than a visit to London. We savored our time here and hope we have the good fortune to return.","en"
"101",5,"We loved this place and will certainly return in years to come. a welcoming place to stay after a 20+ hour journey from Sydney. The 3 bed apartment we had is located in the main building and it's great to have a 24 hour staffed front desk which ads to the security. The hotel is so well situated close to Baywsater and Queensway tube stations, buses on Bayswater road, and good restaurants on Westbourne Grove. Bus or tube will take you right into the heart of london and key sights within 10-15 mins. It's close enough to feel like you're part of it but away from the real hectic parts of town. We stayed for 5 nights and wanted more. Walking distance to Hyde Park including Kensington Palace. Great for an active traveller with some superb morning runs in Hyde Park. We walked 10-15min to Portobello Rd markets in Notting Hill and had a great morning there. Space in the apartment was good by London standards but dont expect to have a party in the ensuite bathroom where you can barely 'swing a cat'! Safe nieghbourhood with an appropriate number of people out and about to feel safe around the clock. Hotel staff were wonderful and the resident hotel cat 'zeus' was a huge hit with our kids. If you're heading to London with the family or as a couple this place is brilliant.","en"

"104",5,"We booked in because we got a fairly good rate and wanted a place for one night near to the Paddington Express for a transfer to Heathrow and New York. This place smelled strongly of fresh paint, and there was a large scrum of irate guests in reception when we arrived. We soon discovered that this was only the second night the place had been open. In fairness to the staff, they were having a nightmare with systems such as cleaning and security failing, but seemed to be handling it with varying degrees of professionalism. We were ushered, by rabbit-in-the-headlights staff, into the (not yet open) bar area, where we had to ask for a cup of tea (no licence for alcohol). We waited half an hour before being given the keycard to a room which we discovered was already occupied! Fortunately we realised this only by the fact that the room had luggage in it. We then waited a bit longer and were escorted to a smallish, but now unoccupied room. The TV didn't work and we slowly discovered that the air con was unnecessarily set to heating (apparently the rooms were all set to heat and didn't have independent controls), so we slowly baked through the night. I was most p*ssed off by the fact that, amongst the carnage of everything going wrong at check in, the staff managed to stick to their unusual policy of insisting on up-front payment. I should have walked out at that point but we were tired and didn't realise it would get worse. Perhaps they've now rectified their problems, but given how badly-managed their opening was, I wouldn't bet on it.","en"
"105",5,"All I can say is THANKS a million for making our stay at Claridge's truly a memorable one! We chose to stay at Claridge's for two nights, to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary. I was full of anticipation since I got a very good impression of Claridge´s after seeing the BBC documentary ""Inside Claridge´s"". I was really excited to find out if they would deliver up to my expectations, and indeed they exceeded my expectations! When I made the reservation through Grand Luxury Hotels, I added information about the purpose of our stay, i.e. To celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary. I was not expecting them to make something big out of it, except for maybe a small bottle of something bubbly as a welcome gesture. To our huge surprise, they upgraded us to a Mayfair suite! Agnes and her colleagues at the reception were really helpful. Since we arrived a bit early, our room was not yet ready, but she gave us a hint that they had arranged a surprise for us! The suite is spotless and immaculately decorated in Art deco style (my favorite!), with a separate sitting room and a huge italian marble bathroom. Interior design is a hobby interest of mine, and staying in this fabulous suite was like being in heaven! I really can´t thank Claridge´s enough! And it doesn´t end here! A shortly after we arrived at the suite, a beautiful plate of dessert was delivered to us, stating ""Happy anniversary"" in chocolate writing! In addition, they also arranged for us to have afternoon tea the next day! Afternoon tea at the Foyer was fantastic! Our hostess Gabrielle, was really great! She even gave us sweets to take back home to our two girls, and since we weren´t able to finish the cakes, she had them sendt up to our suite later that evening! Breakfast was also divine! The selection was vast, ranging from traditional english breakfast to japanese. There were also healthy options like the super healthy brekfast. The staff at the Foyer/ Reading room were very friendly and always greated us with a smile. I hade Eggs royale the first day and japanese brekfast the second day. Both were perfect to my palate, allthough the japanese breakfast was larger than I imagined! Lastly, I also have to add that I contacted Claridge´s prior to our arrival, as I was thinking about spending one afternoon at Hyde park having a picnic. I asked the consierge if it was possible to borrow a picnic blanket since we were travelling light. I received a prompt and friendly response that they could provide us a sturdy blanket to use for our picnic. By the time we checked in, our plans had changed and I forgot all about the picnic plans. Obviously, the staff at Claridges hadn´t! When we arrived at our suite, there was a picnic blanket waiting for us there! Everyone at Claridge´s are so professional, yet very friendly! They all made us feel at home and we were treated like VIPs! The staff was always ready to cater to whatever requests we had, and their attention to details is unparallelled! I have never experienced such great hospitality! I remember from the documentary that someone stated that Claridge´s wanted to give the customers a reason to come back. I must say that for my part, they have truly achieved this goal! Claridge´s played a great part in making our anniversary weekend one that we will never forget! They have also given us a wonderful story to tell our children in the future! Once again, thank You all so much! Until next time!","en"
"106",3,"One can't beat the location if one is travelling on the Eurostar and one doesn't want to travel more than a few hundred feet before checking in. That having been said, the hotel is extremely expensive for what one gets. The rooms are pretty standard for a Marriott but boy oh boy do you pay for the convenience of staying above the train station. As a quick look on trip advisor will show you, there are many many higher rated hotels in London at this price point! Moreover, if you are ""only"" a gold level Marriott member, they don't provide lounge access like pretty much every other Marriott hotel on the planet nor do they make that clear when you reserve. Still they do provide breakfast, internet and some other miscellaneous benefits so I'll call this one a wash (but one shoudl be forewarned of course).","en"

The staff were very friendly and helpful and nothing was any problem for them. Our apartment had everything needed for a comfortable stay. The shower was always hot and the bed was comfortable. We faced the street but the traffic noise wasn't too bad and seemed to die down later at night. It certainly didn't keep us awake. The apartments are in easy walking distance to many tourist attractions and a 2 minute walk to the tube station. There are a lot of places to eat nearby. We had a lovely 2 weeks.","en"

We paid just under £90 for a standard double room with continental breakfast.

The building is a converted Victorian house (apparently once the residence of the Earl of Strathmore) offering lots of charm. The lounge/bar looked welcoming although we were too busy to use it. There are lots of great cafes and bistros within walking distance also. We would definitely stay there again.","en"

The property itself is small by Hilton standards and does not have the huge crowds that can be annoying in bigger properties. The hotel was remodeled recently, the rooms were modern and comfortable. Breakfast is charged 30 pounds or you can get it for free if you want the opportunity to upgrade for 40 pounds - that felt like highway robbery which is why I am not giving 5 stars.

"111",3,"Stayed here overnight while visiting the Spirit of Christmas Fayre at Olympia. We chose the hotel due to it's proximity to Olympia, which is only a couple of minutes walk away. The reception staff were extremely helpful and managed to change our room from a double to a twin, which we were unable to pre-book due to no availability. After a long day walking round the exhibition/fayre we were looking forward to relaxing over a couple of glasses of wine! We went down to dinner at 8.00pm and were surprised that the restaurant was not only extremely quiet but absolutely freezing! We had left our coats upstairs so had to sit there and shiver throughout our meal! The food was absolutely fine but unfortunately due to the complete lack of any ambience and the freezing conditions, we really didn't enjoy it and couldn't wait to get back to our room to warm up again. The bar area had a few more people in it, but yet again it was really cold. We slept well in our room, which was clean and had everything you needed, apart from the television which only had 5 or 6 channels which actually worked - even the hotel menu didn't work to give you the channel listings. They could really do with getting some better showers, as the pressure was so low that you only really got a trickle of water out of it. The real positive of the hotel was the breakfast! The room was cold once again, but not quite as bad and we dressed accordingly! The array of food was good together with the service. The muffins were absolutely fantastic! We would possibly stay here again, as it is so convenient, but found the prices quite high, even by pre-booking and paying in advance, but as we don't normally stay in London, maybe this is the going rate for hotels in this area? The big plus though were the reception staff - really friendly and helpful and I'd have given them 4 stars!","en"

Let's start with the few good things; friendly staff, great location and fast internet.

I had a evening flight on my check out date and I booked the room with lounge so that I could work there the whole day but of course the lounge closed at 11am for some reason!!!!!!. I was really tired after hectic work week in London and wanted to sleep late but of course the housekeeping started to knock my door at 7:50am!!!! and couldn't sleep after that. This hotel advertises that they have 24h room service. Tried to order Club Sandwich at 10pm but of course that wasn't available at that hour, instead I was offered soup or cold breads!!!

The hotel is quite a distance from downtown London (Trafalgar Square).

"116",4,"My husband and I wanted to take his three kids (now teenagers) to London for a mini break. This hotel had been recommended to us as it is used by large companies when attending big corporate events. Thanks to knowing the right people we were very lucky to receive a discount to use the hotel. Our friend who had arranged this asked them to take 'very good care' of us and that's exactly what they did. The rooms were exceptionally clean and had all facilities you would expect from a very good hotel. We had amazing views of the Thames, including the O2 arena. We had lunch at the hotel on one day and this was quite reasonable price wise. The facilities were ok and I'd imagine standard for a hotel in London. The spa was large and there was a small pool and jacuzzi which was fine and very clean. The saunas were male and female in the changing rooms. The beds in the room were extremely comfortable and great after a long day of walking around London. There was more of a limited choice of restaurants to eat in right by the hotel however the Caribbean restaurant looked nice and the area is up and coming so in a few months I imagine it to be more bustling with bars and restaurants. Overalls this was a great hotel with fairly decent location for what we wanted- great if you're heading to the O2 or Excel.","en"

When we reported, we were told to wait somebody until tomorrow to fix it (had shower with cold water). Staff didn't offer any kind of help, they just told us it cant be fixed same day (could offer another room or eventually upgrade and apologies). Staff is not trained very well, they don't speak language smoothly. Our 2nd morning, fire alarm turned on several times. Nobody contacted us to advise if we need to leave the hotel or no. Once we got down to the front desk, we were told it was mistake and that everything is ok now. We couldn't call them as phone was not connected.

Whilst the hotel was ideally situated, I found the room small and the hotel very tired looking, although clean. Part of the deal was a free evening meal on the first night. This was a disappointment we had very poor service and substandard quality of food. The waiter staff just didn't seem interested (I will mention that this meal was taken in the adjoining sister hotel the President, not the Imperial) On the plus side the breakfasts, which were served in the Imperial's own restaurant, we were completely satisfied there was a good selection of food,and the staff being very helpful, a complete contrast to the service we received on the first nights meal in the President. The Hotels are ideally situated for the public transport, underground and bus routes,not far from the mainline stations, also near many of the theatres, particularly in the Covent Garden area. The staff in reception were also very helpful, many of London's main attractions could be pre-booked at reception, in some cases with a small discount, which was a help. Would I stay there again?

The hotel was within easy walking distance from the National Gallery, the British Museum as well as adjacent neighborhoods such as Soho and Piccadilly Circus. Easy access to 3 underground stations including Covent Garden, Leicester Square, and Tottenham Court Road. The neighborhood has charming streets with many shops and restaurants. We were a little concerned having so many theaters nearby but Covent Garden/Soho is definitely not Times Square, and it is a very good place for couples as well as families regardless of whether you are interested in theaters. The traffic from Heathrow took a lot of time once the car got in the city. If you are staying only for a day or two, you may consider a neighborhood towards the west like South Kensington. The Junior Suite (Rm. 317) we stayed in on the third floor was substantially more spacious and the price more reasonable compared with junior suites at other hotels ranked high on Trip Advisor. This was perfect for a family of three with a young adult. But the attraction of the room was not just the size. The room had multiple large windows giving a lot of sunlight. While the room was facing a street with office buildings but high trees not only hid the sight of the buildings but also gave us the feeling as if we were staying in a second house in the suburbs (not sure how the view looks during winter). There was no noise either from the street or from other rooms. This room was simply one of the most charming hotel rooms we have stayed in. From the reception to cleaning/laundry to concierge, service was high quality and consistent throughout our stay. The staffs were reserved but very professional and friendly when we spoke to them. Brasserie Max provided excellent breakfast choices with good selection including excellent English breakfast dishes such as kippers, black pudding and kedgeree. Kippers were especially superb. Overall, we truly enjoyed our stay at the Covent Garden Hotel. It was one of our best boutique hotel experiences in a long time.","en"
"131",3,"The location is very good. However, rooms at this property can be extremely small. While the property is clean and the rooms well appointed the size of two rooms I stayed in were astonishingly small even by European standards. Enough room for a double bed with no room left over - to the point where it would be difficult for some people to manoeuvre around the room. Realistically a 4 star NOT 5 star.","en"
"132",4,"This is the best value hotel I've ever stayed at in London. The building is modern and well-maintained, the room was clean and well-equipped (good TV, air conditioning etc), the staff were friendly and helpful, the bathroom & shower were fantastic and the location is very good for anyone wishing to explore west London. The room cost only £81 which is very cheap for London so I was not expecting the place to be great. In fact, this was fantastic value and I will certainly be looking to stay here again, next time I go to the cricket at Lord's.","en"

It is also walking distance from Stratford metro station allowing you quick and easy access to London transportation system. The hotel has an excellent restaurant, modern facilities, comfortable rooms and hospitable staff. It is an excellent choice for both the business and leisure traveller. It also provides a business centre with free Internet and printer access (24×7) and WiFi is very high speed all across the hotel. Restaurant serves halal food and has a delicious taste; though late night options for room service are limited. Plenty of restaurants nearby though. Best of all Central London is also easily accessible through metro or bus so location is excellent with a great value for money.","en"
"136",4,"Stopped here for one night on my own, its a a good hotel. I was warmly welcomed at the door and at the casual reception desk. Check in was very simple and I was shown to my room and given a brief introduction to what you get. The bedroom was very nicely decorated and spacious. There was a comfortable large double bed, flat tv, air con, tea making and mini bar. The bathroom was not large but very stylish with a double sink and large shower. In the evening a member of staff brought a newspaper and ice bucket to my room. I tried the cafe restaurant which is a casual place serving classic british themed menu. The food and service was excellent and priced reasonably. I enjoyed my stay here I settled in quickly and felt very relaxed during my stay. I have a few things that I would ask the hotel to consider for future guests that could make it even better and add more justification to the fairly high price: The breakfast was very disappointing for the money £13 for toast in a tray without a plate, one tiny portion of jam only and a bowl of museli is not good. The tea and coffee tray is great with the tea pot and caffetere but it does need decaffinated options, hot chocolate and a range of teas which is now standard in most hotels It would be nice to get some bottled water in the room. There was a lot of late night noise from the street outside but I am not sure what they would do about this but it did spoil my sleep.","en"

"147",1,"What on earth are people expecting? If you have paid more than the £70 that we paid (the Saturday before Xmas) then you need to shop around. We booked with Discount City Hotels (online). We found the staff to be very helpful from the minute we arrived. We found a leak in our bathroom and the staff immediately gave us a new room without any problems. The rooms are small, we think they might have been singles originally because of the single headboard fixed above our small double bed, however, why do you want to spend so much time sitting in a London hotel room? We like to make the most of our short stays and exlore the capital which seems to keep going 24 hours a day! And that's why we go there. Location is 5 mins walk from Oxford Street and the West End theatres etc. and the British museum is almost next door. If you are hungry, walk for 10 mins to China Town in Soho and eat as much as you like from £4.99 to £8.90. Breakfast in the hotel is served in a contemporary styled dining room (full English or continental and loads of food to help yourself to if you want). We have stayed in a variety of places and since our regular hotel is now closed this is definately a good alternative (so long as we get a good deal !!!!). So basically you have to decide what is really important and if you want to be pampered and fussed around then go book into the Savoy! This hotel was clean, friendly, cheap and easily accesible. That's what is important to us.","en"

"151",5,"From the time I made my reservation until the time I left the service was excellent. At the arrival, a very nice lady leads you to scan your bags (I guess because it's the highest building in London) she gives you all the information you need to get to the hotel reception (located on the 35th floor). I was so chocked how fast the lift got to the 35th, it literally takes seconds I guess. The reception is beautifully decorated, the staff are so helpful and friendly. I got a complimentary tea which came in a medium size wooden box, which looks like a make up box, they give a little tour when you get in your room, they made sure that we knew about their skypool on the 52th floor which I made used of later on. I stayed in a deluxe room which had amazing, stunning views of London, and when the sunset arrived it was so beautiful that I could stare it all night long. The infinitive pool which is indoors due to our London weather is open from 6am until 8pm. When I got there with my boyfriend it was empty, not too warm water since there is no windows but you get used to the water temperature ... There is water, fruit, towels, etc. Stunning views of London plus marvellous decoration with tables and chairs which after 8pm you can have drink by the pool. The room features are very advance but easy to use. We had breakfast included at Lang which was buffet breakfast with a bit of everything. Once again very friendly and helpful staff even the managers would come and ask if everything was ok. Pricey but you don't just pay for the view, the service was a 5th star service. Can't wait to visit this hotel again, perhaps in a different city. Don't usually write reviews but this was needed.","en"

"153",3,"Booked this hotel because of the location @ 8CS and the facilities - was arriving/leaving with time to use them. Had been here about 5 years ago and it was ok then, but nothing special. Then someone told me it was being blacklisted by my company, so I rushed to tripadvisor & was shocked at some of the reports. Mind you, I couldn't cancel so prepared for the worst. Arrived 2:30pm & a queue of 3 took 20 mins to clear - clearly not customer focused. Had to be escorted to my room - new room key system was playing up. Went to the facilities - £2.50 charge - you've got to be joking - we always book hotels with a pool & have never ever been charged. Complained & the manager gave me a free pass. Pool is ok, but needed a clean just above water level. The power shower was scalding. Sauna and steam were excellent. Slept well in a nice spacious clean room - same as many I've stayed in. Was expecting breakfast to be a mare, but it was absolutely fine. Fresh fruit, choice of cereals, normal cooked choice, hot coffee on every table, clean cutlery etc and attentive staff. Yes, I'd stay overnight again.","en"

"160",5,"Visited this hotel on the 9th April after being lucky enough to secure tickets to the Anthony Joshua Fight Night at the O2 The hotel could literally not be more convenient for events at the O2, it is right next door and when you're ready to head in for your event you walk round the Reception desk, down a corridor, cross the road and into the arena coming in at Block 111. I don't know whether the road area will be covered eventually as part of the walkway but even if it's not it's literally like crossing your average road, not an issue in the slightest The hotel is immaculate, the bars are well set out and comfortable. The hotel was clearly full but check in moved like a breeze, we didn't wait more than a few minutes. We ordered room service on arrival (at around 4pm when everyone was checking in and the restaurants/bars were full with people dining before the event which started from 6) but we still only waited 30 minutes. The food was really nice, arrived hot and was well presented. We were up too late to want to go for breakfast after enjoying the sky bar in the hotel until the early hours, so we ordered breakfast to the room, conveniently available until 11:3am, again it arrived within 30 minutes and was delicious, hot and well presented. The skybar has amazing views and really nice staff, well worth a trip We booked the basic room as we knew we would barely be in it but to be honest it was enough. We had views of the River, the O2, the room was a good size, the bed was large and comfortable, the bathroom was great, and even though the place was filled with however many hundred boxing fans it was peacefully quiet Check out again was a breeze. We decided to get the tube back to the station as it had taken us an hour to get to the hotel from central London the day prior, the very polite doorman gave us exact directions and happily we found ourselves at the underground after a short walk This hotel is brand new, it looks it, it feels it, but it's not ran like it. We didn't encounter a single hiccup, the place runs like clockwork and if we ever attend events at the O2 in the future we won't be looking to stay anywhere else Oh and a quick thank you to Ariane and Melanie who helped with my email questions and requests!","en"

"164",5,"Just got back from 6 nights with my wife and teenage daughter and couldn't have been more pleased. The studio suite we had($130/night) was as nice as any room I've stayed in in the US - with sleek decor - two flat screens, lots of wardrobe space/drawers and a beautiful bathroom. Every inch of its relatively tight space was nicely used. Despite the once less-desirable south-of-the-Thames location - it really was a nice location for our London excursions. It was just a 5 minute walk or so walk down the street to the Waterloo tube and probably 7-10 lovely minutes across the Westminster Bridge to that tube stop. Thought the hotel sits by itself - with no immediately visible restaurant/grocery amenities next to it, there are probably a half dozen nearly new restaurants - from Subway to Starbucks to Yo! Sushi within a 2-3 minute walk across the street (on the back side of office buildings you can't see from the hotel) - as well as a convenience store/small grocery (w/ATM). Go another 2 minutes for a McDonald's in the County Hall complex on the Thames river walk. Probably 7 minutes away from hotel, along the Thames at the South Bank Centre complex, past the London Eye, are another 8-10 great-looking sitdown eateries of all types - including the tasty Giraffe (great for families), Latin and Asian places - and our favorite restaurant of the trip - the Wagamama noodle bar. These restaurants were full of professionals and theater/concert goers during our visits. Great place. Hotel overall is beautiful and unlike anything else I've seen in London. Very U.S.-like - so don't stay here if you're looking for a quaint old hotel with UK character. Internet access was a relatively cheap $4 or so an hour (you buy cards with scratch-off codes at the front desk... They didn't have 1 hour cards - so gave me 4 hour cards for the same price!) Despite comments of others, we had no real issues getting elevators (there are only 3) despite spending 6 days there. Once only, we descended the nice stairs (great view outside) 5 floors to the lobby due to overcrowded elevators going down. All other elevator uses were without issue. If you truly want to be in the thick of things - shops, restaurants and tube stops 1 minute away - then pick Leicester Sqare or Oxford Street, etc... Otherwise, pick a place like the Park Plaza - which has deceptively convenient amenities and services nearby if you just do a little detective work when you get there. Only negatives... The A/C system was weak, weak, weak and the temperature adjustment knob was as imprecise as a knob of a kid's toy... No temp markings - just turned it left or right... Had it been much hotter than 70 F outside - which it was all week - it might have been extra hot in the room - but we just got by at that temp. No perceptible air movement - and only works when you have a room key in a slot - which they happily take out of the slot if you leave room with system in use (which anyone would want to to try to get a headstart on cooling room when you return at end of day). Whether Euro folks like A/C or not - the cooling system is unacceptable by any reasonable standards... - even terribly relaxed ones... Also - a sort-of negative - the shower door is a pretty one - but a a giant glass one, too - without any sort of major metal supports or door guards (they were going for a clean look) -.. and we feared, all week, that we or our 12 year old would make one false move - and the entire thing would break into a million little glass pieces if we just tapped it wrong or we didn't enter the shower ""just so""","en"

"167",3,"I stayed in this hotel with my boyfriend for 6 nights at the end of August/beginning September 2016. If you read the reviews and look at the pictures heading into your reservation, you'll know exactly what to expect. I booked their standard double room, and it was definitely small. Bathroom had been renovated and was very nice. There isn't space in the double to really hang out, but there is a small desk and a wardrobe to store stuff. If you're planning to not be in your hotel room a lot, this is a great hotel. You aren't paying an arm and a leg, and you get just enough with overpaying. It's right around the corner from the Earl's Court tube station and it on two of the major lines where most destinations can be accessed - that in itself is invaluable! The breakfast is basic, with some cereals, yogurt, and toast, along with tea and coffee, but I don't know what more people were expecting from a continental breakfast in a small boutique hotel. We couldn't hear that much stuff going on outside our hotel, but it is an older building so movement will be heard. Towels were big and really soft and housekeeping was great. They stored our bags for us when we arrived early in the morning and even put them in our room for us. They also hold your room key when you leave the hotel so you don't have to worry about it. I'd recommend for travelers looking to save some money but still be comfortable!","en"

"169",5,"I've been meaning to start writing reviews on TripAdvisor for a while, and my one night stay in the Savoy on Saturday was of such a high standard that I thought this would be good one to start with. I've stayed in many hotels in Europe and the United States. This is by some margin the most impressed I've ever been by a hotel stay. Almost everything about the ambiance is exactly what I think many people imagine a luxury hotel should be. There's a kind of old-fashioned glamour about the place that somehow just feels ""right"". Our room was spacious (both bedroom and bathroom) and elegantly appointed. The bed was luxurious and comfortable. Almost everything in the hotel was spotless and in great condition. Our complementary Wi-Fi was easy to log on to, and very usable. The hotel has done a great job of making the rooms feel individually designed (even if they're not) and refreshingly ""uncorporate"". We didn't eat in the hotel (we had dining plans elsewhere), but did have a drink in the American Bar. Our cocktails were made to an exceptionally high standard - better than in most bars that claim to be serious about cocktails, and equal to the best of any other cocktail bar I've been to. What really made the hotel stand out from others, though, were the staff. Every single member of staff in the hotel that we interacted with - the doormen, the lady who greeted us and to show us around the hotel and check us in, the hostess at the American bar who seated us so quickly, the chambermaid who did the turn down service and brought fresh towels when we asked, the receptionist in the Reading Room who looked after us at checkout and took care of storing our bags - was fabulous, polite, friendly and competent. You might not think that's too much to ask - to be honest, neither do I! However, the truth is - in most hotels it's pretty rare to find a single member of staff that reach the high standards that every single member of staff at The Savoy appears to be at. Of course, as with many hotels, they have their little tricks to try to make the guests feel special - like the very smooth way they greet you by name as you walk through the front door. However, in contrast to many other hotels, the way these are executed at the Savoy really work - it almost never feels like anything other than a genuine desire to provide a great experience. For anyone that doesn't know London well, one of the convenient things about The Savoy is its central location. The Strand, itself, isn't a particularly appealing road - aside from anything else, the volume of traffic is high. However, it is in the heart of the West End - it's literally two minutes to walk to Covent Garden, for example. And it's just a short cab or tube ride to places like Mayfair or Knightsbridge. Based on our stay, there were only a few things that could be improved, but they're mostly pretty minor. For example, the iPod dock in the room doesn't seem to work with iPhones, which is a shame. For some reason, on the television, Channel 5 didn't work. Possibly the biggest criticisms I'd have would be that the decor in the American Bar didn't have the ""wow factor"" that other parts of the hotel do, and the best bars elsewhere, manage to achieve; and also that our room didn't have a standalone shower (it was part of the bath). As I said earlier, we didn't eat in the hotel, so I can't comment on the standard of the food. I guess the fact that we'd booked elsewhere to eat, though, does say that, at least for our tastes, there weren't any options that are as appealing as other some other restaurants in London. We didn't have time to use the spa or gym facilities, so I can't comment on those either. Obviously, The Savoy isn't the cheapest option in London. However, if you're in the market for spending the amount of money they charge for a room, and you want a great base for a visit to London, I don't think you'll be disappointed.","en"

Essentially you have your bedroom and bathroom in one room, with just frosted glass separating the toilet/shower from the bed, some people might want a bit more privacy but it doesn't bother me in the slightest and I thought it was pretty clever what they have done with the space! It's a very modern looking room with a great shower, a very comfortable bed and a big flat screen tv if you need one! The staff were very helpful and happy to deal with anything, best of all.. each night in the z hotels, for free..

"175",4,"We booked a triple room from lastminute.com for £178 for 2 nights which you could hardly complain about. The first night was my wife and I and we were joined in London by our 20yr old daughter for the second. The room was basically a decent-size double with a bed-settee but still good enough for 3 adults. I've stayed in far smaller hotel rooms in cities around the world for higher rates. It was very clean, the bathroom was also decent-size and it too, was spotless. There was a small-ish flat-screen HD TV on the wall with a better selction of channels than you get in, say, the Holiday Inn and enough cupboard space for our belongings. Only negative point on the room was the shower head was in serious need of descaling but as there was another shower spray connected to the taps, we left it until checkout to report. It's a small hotel with only about 36 rooms, the lobby is small too and the lift is, well, don't try and get more than two in it with small luggage. If you have any larger valuable items e.g. laptop they will store it for you in reception but not anywhere particularly secure. It basically just goes in a cupboard and they give you a ticket as a receipt. All of the staff were very friendly and helpful. Location-wise it is good; it's less than a 5-minute walk to Earl's Court tube which has access to the District and Piccadilly lines; you can be in Covent Garden in 10-15 mins. There are plenty of eateries nearby inc Chinese, Indian, Nando's, KFC and lots of takeaways. So, all-in-all, we had absolutely none of the problems I've read about on here. would I stay there again? Definitely.","en"

We had an extra bed brought in for the second teenager and there was still heaps of room to move about. Staff could not have done enough to help us.... Would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a great stay in London","en"
"180",4,"But the room we stayed in was too small for the price we paid. But manager agreed with me and I have got 20% back even I did not ask for it (just to make me happy as a customer...and It did make me happy:)..). Though, we checked in around 11am (taxi from Kings Cross was 10 pounds and it is only 3 underground stations away) . That really made us happy since we came early just to drop our luggage. Checking out could be extended to 2pm. So convenient! Rooms are different shape since it is an older building (former brewery- very interesting), so you'd better check first if you like the room Our friends from States were staying on first floor and the ceiling was really high and bathroom was a size of the whole room! . You cam make your own tea and will have 1 complimentary bottle of water,also cookies, apples, bananas complimentary every morning. The hotel has tho dining places on each side, but both were having private parties on that Friday and we did not know about it and had to go to Cote (not sure of spelling) just across the street and the place is not overpriced and dinner was ok (especially at 10 pm). St Paul cathedral is 15 min walking distance, but we already visited it before. So, we decided just look around...and found MUSEUM OF LONDON! That was our luck that we stopped by! Do not miss it! The museum is incredible and we spent there 4 hours! Do not miss it! Doorman was very helpful and information desk guys were very knowledgeable. There is a mall close to St Paul, go to the sixth floor and you can see London from public terrace (we have been told but never made it!). Although, we looked at London from Shard's 72nd floor and it was spectacular. We waited for sunset but unfortunately clouds covered the sunset . You can go to restaurant's entrance and see London from 32nd or 33rd floor, but if you want not only drink but eat , you have to make reservation in 2 months if you will be lucky! And we did not think of asking hotel to do it for us:)... There was not one person on Ground floor who would not say Hello using your own name! That was very unusual because I never can remember people's names:). Personnel is trained very well! Next day, I had to come back to pick up my friend's left item, and they still remembered my name. So, if you will leave something behind, your item could be shipped to you up to 5 pounds cost for shipping (calculate ahead:). I really wanted to say that I was impressed by service!","en"
"181",3,"This hotel is all about location and price so don't go there expecting 5-star treatment!!! Probably not a great place for a romantic weekend, but fine for singles or groups of friends. I'd certainly stay there again. Good things about the Astor Court: 1. Only 10 minutes walk from Oxford Circus on a quiet side street 2. Not very expensive considering its central location 3. Very clean, decent-sized room Bad things about the Astor Court: 1. Rooms badly need redecoration 2. Terrible shower - basically an old fashioned bath-tap attachment - not very user-friendly and the bathroom floor ended up soaked every morning! 3. Very limited breakfast - in a very drab, dreary basement room 4. Not very secure luggage store room - it's near the front door and is never locked","en"

Usual high standard of accommodation you expect from Premier Inn, with comfy beds, good amenities. Great breakfast (although the restaurant is a little cramped).

"186",2,"Why on earth would anyone pay the money to stay here when there are so many other lovely hotels in London. The entire hotel is desperate for a massive upgrade. Dr Who wouldn't stay here in any time zone. The entrance and vestibule looked like a refugee camp and and one of the restaurants was stinking of fish, should it not smell of the sea? Anyway we walked in and straight out of the cocktail bar. What a sleazy experience.","en"
"187",4,"We got an incredible deal on this hotel as we were staying midweek in the winter. Also, we had a great room that was spacious with high ceilings. The room was decently comfortably, especially given the price point. There was no one around so we had all of the staff's attention and they were able to offer their full assistance in helping me with some urgent errands. I was very grateful for their assistance. The lift is a bit slow and the lobby looks and feels a bit cheap but that wasn't a if deal for us. The location is great and if I got the same pricing I would stay there again for a short trip.","en"

"190",3,"It wasnt the best entrance when our waiter walked off, then beckoned us to the table. Our waiter was a young nervous chap, but nice. We got our first drink then i waited 10 mind for a too up?(bottom less intervals) . We got our food and the ""other"" waiter didnt explain the food content and walked off. We eere left waiting probaly twice for a top up. Then aftet 45 mins into our 90 minute drinks. I said sorry are you closing?!? Our waiter said ""yes we are finishing"", i said sorry I am not, said why he was ignoring me ? His manager said only to them up if asked. I expressed dis gratitude and how it is poor etiquette to beg for drinks gor 90 mins. If this was the culture than one must communication on entry. I felt fustrated, and the poor waiter left the bottle. I said once our 90 mins are done can i speak to the manager prior to us leaving. I went to the toilet to return to another bottle. My partner said thT the waiter sent this over compliments of the manager. This arrogance and disrespectful gesture, who couldn't be bothered to speak to me is shocking. The cost price of this bottle was a about £3.50 . The waiter was the messenger snd the manager a coward . Service is all about personality and respect. If you came and spoken me I would of bought another bottle. Its not aBout the money but principle.","en"

We stayed in the executive suite which was spotlessly clean and well maintained. All in all it made for a 1st class stay on a memorable occasion. Thank You Accor I would have no hesitation in recommending this Hotel.","en"
"193",2,"I stayed here briefly on a stopover from LHR... and since it was free, thanks to a special deal on BA, I was somewhat skeptical. But, it was totally fine, and conveniently located. I had a single, and it was a true single: single bed, small room, small bath. But everything was quite fine. I was most surprised that, although it was a basic, no-frills room, it had a mini-fridge. It is very close to the Tube. There are lots of shops and restaurants, including places that are open late, which was convenient as a traveler arriving late. A breakfast voucher was included (coffee, juice, cereal, pastries; additional options for a surcharge), and while it wasn't noteworthy, it was perfectly fine, but I wouldn't have paid for breakfast, as there are plenty of options nearby that would certainly be better.","en"
"194",4,"The Park Plaza was an excellent choice for our group of 8. Each of us had an terrific and modern room with great amenities (microwave, minibar fridge, safe, ironing board, hair dryer). The location was just superb!!! We were just across Westminster Bridge from the Abbey, Parliament, etc. and just down the street from the Eye. Two tube stops (Waterloo and Westminster) were within easy walking distance, though I thought it was easier access to Westminster. There were all kinds of restaurants around the hotel and some very hot-looking night spots, though we didn't venture into any. The hotel restaurant had good food and we were able to get a wide selection of alcohals from the bar. Overall, the the hotel was above average with the only problem being a lot of the staff were from foreign countries and did not have complete control of the English language. This led to some minor communication problems.","en"
"195",2,"This hotel looks absolutely stunning and I'm sure the staff in the rest of the hotel are great (the doormen in the lobby were very warm, friendly and inviting). My boyfriend and I went to the Silks bar on a Sunday afternoon, we sat down and looked through the drinks menu waiting for someone to come and serve us. The bar was extremely quiet, with only 3 other tables of 2 people each occupied. Eventually we gave up waiting and I went to the bar, asking for 2 large Rosé Pinot Grigio. The girl took out white wine and I corrected her before she started pouring. Even though I had asked for large, she gave us 2 small wine glasses even though large wine glasses were visible on the shelf behind her. Because of the size of the glass I couldn't tell if the content was the same a large...so wondering why I paid £18.22 for just that! With all honesty I did not want to embarrass her as she looked very new and inexperienced (or maybe she did not care about me as a customer). I took the glasses back to our table and we admired the beautiful room and furniture. And we also noticed how dirty it was... there was an empty water bottle on the floor which was clearly visible, there was crumbs on another table, empty alcohol bottles on another table, there was dried up marks from glasses on our table, our table was also sticky and the black tables were so badly scratched they should have been replaced long ago. We had found this place walking through London during a quiet Sunday afternoon and decided to stay for a few drinks when we entered, but during that 1st drink we were put off. The staff in the bar were not welcoming or engaging at all","en"
"196",5,"As a ""first timer"" in London prior to this trip, I wanted a place that would be secure and safe to walk at night. I wanted a quieter area of London but close enough to the attractions I wanted to see. I chose this hotel because it caters to the female traveler who travels alone by providing extra locks as well as female maids and room service servers. This hotel is a ""gem"" and I will stay here again when I return to London in the future. The Montague on the Garden is an intimate boutique hotel rated Four-Star Deluxe by the RAC and AA. Five Crown Silver Award from the English Tourist Board. It Overlooks a secluded garden square including a private conservatory. Guests can walk to Covent Garden, the West End theatres as well the British Museum which is located across the street from the hotel. I had a superior double room which looked out over a lovely garden. The bed was very comfortable, the temperature gauge kept the room at a constant temperature, the towels in the bathroom were thick, and thirsty. Many amenities included an in room safe, web tv (this was a bit difficult to see as the resolution was poor and it was a bit pricey at 7.00 bps for one hour of use), mineral water, a blow dryer, an iron and a trouser press, and very nice bathrobes to use during your stay. Excellent room service as well. There is a sitting room on the ground floor where one may entertain guests which I did on 3 separate occasions. There were no glares or stares from the staff as a matter of fact, Mustapha the concierge, stepped forward to snap a picture or two for us. It was just like entertaining in my home. The staff is most competent and polite, they go out of the way to assist in making your stay a memorable one. Another unique item that this hotel provided for the room which I have never seen before, was a full compliment of business implements such as scotch tape, a stapler, a pair of scissors, paper clips as well as plain envelopes, pens and pencils. This came in so handy when I had to wrap a gift or two! The Montague has a very lovely high tea for a reasonable price, which rivals many upscale places that offer a high tea in London, they also have the Blue Door Bistro restaurant where you can have dinner at the Chef's table in the kitchen! Now how cool is that?","en"
"197",4,"Our family of four stayed here for several nights over the Easter holiday. The hotel is a very basic, no-frills place. The rooms were small and sparsely furnished (no phone but flat screen TV) but clean. We felt safe here, even with our teen daughters occupying a separate room on the first night (when the ""family room"" was not available). A grocery store was located within easy walking distance (basically on the other side of the same complex), and I would stroll over to buy breakfast and snack items and bring them back to my family. The hotel does offer food service, but it is basically quick-heat food and not what I would consider a ""true"" restaurant. It served perfectly for a base to explore London. Yes, it was a walk to the train (you could wait for a bus at a bus stop quite near the hotel if you wanted to ride to the train station but you could get there much faster on foot). Yes, it was a bit of a ride into the attractions in London. But we used the ride in to ""wake up"" and plan our day - and the ride home at night to rest and recap our day's events. You would not want to stay here if you want to be able to go back to the room in the middle of the day - it is too long of a commute. But it was a perfectly AFFORDABLE place for a large family to use as a base to explore London. What we paid for four nights I think was what ONE night would have cost us in central London. Our money was better spent on attractions, etc., as we only wanted a basic room to rest at night (choosing to spend all waking hours exploring London). Price, safety, cleanliness, and convenience to public transportation into London were primary factors for us, and this hotel did not disappoint. We were traveling with my parents as well and enjoyed hanging out in the hotel's restaurant/lobby at night - we played cards and talked about what we had seen in London that day. The front desk staff members - especially Natasha - were extremely accommodating and helpful in answering all of our many questions. I would not hesitate to stay here again or to recommend it to others as long as they realize that it is a basic, ""value"" hotel that, while not in the heart of London, is conveniently accessible to it as long as one doesn't mind a bit of a commute.","en"
"198",4,"We got a very good rate in May 2015 I think because there was a great deal of construction on several sides of the hotel building. The construction didn't bother us at all (couldn't hear much from the room) but the location (aside from all the scaffolds) was perfect: right around the corner from the Tate Modern, and a few blocks from Westminster. The rooms are very clean and the staff seems eager to help, but we didn't speak to anyone at the desk or in a service position who was easy to communicate with in English. We had to repeat things several times, clarify often and many simple requests had to be passed to a colleague because the staff wasn't sure what we were asking. I don't think this is to do with our American accents, I think it's a staff who is largely new to English. They were, however, willing and responsive once we could get the point across. I'd definitely stay again.","en"

I have eaten both the bar food and the carvery and both were excellent. Particularly the Roast Beef in the carvery, The rooms are small enough but that is to be expected in London. That said they are well laid out, clean and comfortable. The beds are fab and I always leave refreshed after a great nights sleep. The breakfast is also of a very high standard. I stay in London regularly for business and only stayed here recently for the first time on a family break to the Westend.

"203",4,"I rarely write reviews however my most recent experience staying at The Crown Plaza Hotel, Ealing provided such a welcoming/warming environment. Business was the predominate reason for staying at the hotel and I can assure anybody who is travelling on business you will not be disappointing. The interior of the hotel is modern and classy. I booked a club room which came with the benefits of the business lounge which was very impressive. The business lounge has a a variety of newspapers, comfortable seating, refreshments and printing facilities. My room was situated on the ground floor a few steps away from reception. It was fantastically set out and the bed was extremely comfortable. Lastly, the staff at this hotel are impeccable. Though I had never stayed at the hotel before, at the reception I was welcomed as if I was returning guest by Anita who was very polite and accommodating. In addition the night manager Abdel was very helpful and provided excellent service. I will definitely be returning soon. I would also recommend joining the IHG reward scheme which is free and has lots of little perks like late check out.","en"
"204",2,"As a paraplegic I am a heavy wheelchair user (I can not stand) and require an accessible room when traveling. When I was booked in to The Grange Hotel I was expecting big things as it's a five star rated hotel. Unfortunately I was wrong to be expecting too much. The room I was given was accessible in as much as I could get access to the room. That's where the accessibility ends for a wheelchair user. The first thing I do when I check in to my room is look at the toilet facilities for equipment and hand rails. The first problem I discovered is that when in the toilet, the door could not be shut with my wheelchair in the room. I notice there were NO hand rails in the bathroom toilet. This made my morning transfer on to the loo a brave leap of faith. The second thing I notice is the lack of call buzzers in the room. Yes, they're annoying and get in the way for ever us wheelchair users but there were non. So if my leap of faith onto the loo failed, I was kinda stuck to my own devices. So, onto the bar for a drink. Half way though the evening I request to use the bars disabled toilets. I was directed to the gents on the lower level. I enter these toilets to find myself stuck through a double door and there being no disable toilet facility in there. So when I finally manage to get out of the gents, it's back to my room to use the facilities there, With the door open! On the whole my stay at the Grange was awkward and frustrating. I shan't be stopping here again and would strongly advise other wheelchair users to look elsewhere for 5* Hotel Accommodation.","en"

After traveling for a month in Europe, it was wonderful to have our own suite with a small washer/dryer, little refrigerator, toaster and even a loaf of bread and some butter, plus milk, that was in the refrig. Breakfast was excellent as was a dinner we ate in their atrium guest-only restaurant. We celebrated a special anniversary and they decorated our bed with rose petals and gave us a bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries.

"208",4,"The hotel is in a great location. On Kensington Street with easy access to transportation. Olympia tube station a couple blocks walk away, bus stop across the street, many restaurants within walking distance. A local food store a mile walk away. Cafe with outdoor seating attached to the hotel. Check in & out was easy as Hilton offers, the service was professional and personable. The room was a TINY two twin room with a not so great view of the a side street below. There were a few up and down steps and twists and turns to get to the room, which was difficult with luggage. Extra locks on the door provided security. The room was clean and neat and was cleaned daily. Not used to having no top sheet on the bed in lieu of only the duvet but managed. I do not know if the duvet was changed during my stay or prior to, but it seemed to have a lingering smell that might indicate it should be changed more frequently. The bathroom was clean and typical amenities provided. The bottom of the wooden door showed signs of water damage and breakage. The thermostat was difficult to regulate. Though it was nice to have a window that opened for fresh air. Good sized armoire for clothes, and luggage. Nice dresser for clothes too. If you are not an overseas traveler and forget a converter adapter, no worries, the concierge will lend one to you for 10 pounds refundable when returned. Paid for breakfast included, it was a good European breakfast with some American adaptations. Hotel restaurant Society Bar & Restaurant, was open regularly and late. There was a good variety of selections and everything was delicious. A great wine selection. Took a tour which picked up right at the hotel. Some hotels are not pick up locations. Small gift shop in hotel, not open to long, but they do issue and take back Oyster cards (used for the tube and bus transports), with a 5 pound deposit, you get that back when you return the card. Overall, I would recommend this hotel, but I might get a larger room next time.","en"

Extra towels provided as soon as we asked. Russell and Wayne on the front desk were so helpful with information and directions and chatting to my grandson. We had breakfast once which was good value. Replenishing things took a little while as there seemed to be only one waiter on duty, but we didn't wait too long. We did ask for extra pillows but told there were no spare. This was only a little niggle though. I understand that air conditioning is being put in the near future.

"218",2,"My daughter and I spent several nights at the Hilton in September as this was the hotel that was included in our London/Paris tour we booked. Our first impression was less than ideal. I had called in the morning to advise that we would be checking in late that evening. There were 2 desk clerks working and both were taking care of other guests. I waited for 10 to 15 minutes without so much as a greeting - or a grunt..... Our room was drab and probably clean, (although the lighting was too dim to tell) but needed a facelift. The buffet breakfast included in our stay was very nice, and the morning staff was pleasant enough. Dinner was another story. I almost left without paying as I was tired of waiting over 20 minutes for our server to return to our table after we finished our dessert and tea. They were not busy, as it was after the usual dinner hour and most tables were empty. There may have been a maximum of 6 parties in all. I finally flagged down a different waiter and asked for our check. The concierge was very helpful the day we missed our tour bus. He stood in front of the hotel for quite sometime before he was able to flag a taxi during morning rush hour. That was my best experience at this hotel. Overall I would not recommend this hotel due to the front desk staff not providing a warm welcome (nor any welcome at all), the dark and dreary rooms, and the poor dinner service in the restaurant.","en"
"219",5,"I have stayed at the Clapham travelled he for the past two weekends, the staff are very friendly and welcoming. Can come across as robots sometimes but that's just my opinion! The room was clean, tidy, smelt clean as well. Bathroom was clean and very pleasent. The bed was AMAZING I loved it so much, so comfy The lighting in the rooms are smart, liked them quite a lot! Improvements to be made: adjustable shower head cause it's quite high up and got my hair wet and I didn't want it to do that. Have more to channels.","en"
"220",3,"Stayed for 2 nights over a weekend. Hotel was very clean and professional. Restaurant menu pricing very reasonable. Room was nice, although shower was a bit dodgy!

"222",5,"Stayed for 1 night in a Deluxe City View room. The hotel is amazing, the rooms are amazing and the view is amazing. Our room had the biggest bed i had ever seen, and it was like sleeping on air. The bathroom had a tv in the mirror a rainfall shower and the toilet had a heated seat and a jet washing system in case you didn't fancy using the 100 ply loo roll. The room has everything you need from sewing kits to binoculars, there a big tv with Sky ect and complimentary coffee/tea and water. Both went swimming in the infinity pool on the 52 floor, towels are provided in the pool area so no need to take the ones out of the room, the pool is heated and there are sun loungers around it, was a perfect place to chill out!! The gym is also on the 52nd floor, its small but perfectly formed, was a bit warm for me but theres a fridge full of water and sweat towels so i survived. Had breakfast in the Ting restaurant, was amazing,they have everything from dim sun to baked beans, i could have spent the day eating in there but it closes at 10.30am and we had slept in. All in all it is expensive but it was worth every penny!!!!","en"

"225",4,"I decided to treat my girlfriend to a weekend in London for her Birthday mid January and after seeing a great deal on rooms at Corus I decided to book as it was close to all of the activities I had planned for us both. We arrived around mid day and were told we could check in slightly early which was brilliant and the staff were very helpful and polite but my reservation clearly stated room upgrade if possible and we had no mention of the upgrade but were told our room would be on the 8th floor and would be sufficient for 2. We entered the room however to find a space barely big enough for the double bed and floor space that was taken up by both our over night bags which were no size at all. I then entered the bathroom shutting the door behind me although it offered no real privacy at all given the size of the room but when i tried to exit I found the door would not open from the inside so if my partner had not of been there or if I was travelling alone i would of been stuck there with my phone on the side by the bed it would of been some predicament. I mentioned this to the staff at reception and in fairness to them they said they would deal with it post haste and upon arriving back at the hotel around 1am we found it had been rectified. Breakfast served was good and a broad range of diets and tastes were catered for and staff again were polite and helpful. overall I feel it was OK for just one night given we were out for most of the night and left again early morning it caused us little upset but for an extended stay a room of that size was barely big enough for one person let alone a couple. I would not hesitate to return i would however request a different room.","en"
"226",5,"Great stay! Stayed last night. Really lovely place. The area is great, Liverpool Street is very interesting. Good architecture all around, a mixture of old Victorian, Edwardian properties, the old shops with their original signage, and sky rises made of glass. Very clean area around the hotel as well. As soon as you step out of this hotel, you're right amongst it. You've got a lot of restaurants and cafe's close by. You're also a short walk from the Barbican theatre which is good to stroll around and soak up the atmosphere (I like the fountains and the courtyard at the back of the Barbican where the Barbican Kitchen is. So lot's to do and see close to this hotel. The Room- it's an apartment. You get a small apartment. Mine had a small kitchen, living room which had double doors leading to a large bedroom. Small entrance hall at the front, leading to the shower room and living room also. Everything you could need! and very relaxing. Price- It's London, it's pricey. I will never understand people who focus on the price of hotels, restaurants when doing reviews. If cost is an issue to you, stay at home and eat a pot noodle. Spare the hard working business owners your ignorant budget based reviews. Or try starting your own business and see the costs and risks involved, maybe then you won't be so ignorant. (If you're offended by this comment, it's because you are one of these cheap ignorant people) Peaceful night sleep. Overall, 5/5. Great stay. Last month I saw Hamlet at the Barbican, and afterwards I did fancy just going straight to bed as it's a late finish. So I think for anyone watching a show there, this is a good place to book and save on that London traffic journey home.","en"
"227",5,"Stay at this hotel last night, in the Millennium building and cannot really fault it at all. Check in was so quick and the staff were friendly, professional and helpful. We didn't have milk in the mini fridge when I called reception to ask for some it was brought to the room within 2 minutes. The room and bathroom were clean. The bed was comfortable and I had a good nights sleep. It was nice to have a little wander around Stamford Bridge and look at information on the club etc. The proximity to Fulham Broadway station is great. Would happily stay here again for the special offer price we got it at.","en"

Ideal if you go to a event at the Royal Albert Hall","en"
"230",3,"The location of this hotel and it's first impressions as you arrive can't be faulted. When we tried to gain access to our room the key cards didn't work. Only after several attempts did we gain access. We then got into the room which was tiny, but clean. My friend wanted to use the pool but was told on arrival that it was £8! When she asked if she could then use the pool the next day as we ere staying overnight she was told no it was £8 every time she wanted to use the facilities. Wifi should be free for residents in a hotel not £9.95 for 24 hours! The water in the bath is scolding hot and there was no cold running water in the bath at all. Even on the cold setting it was warm. There should at least be a sign in the bathroom warning of scolding water. The water pressure is appalling. We put our room service breakfast order on our door as instructed at 6:30pm the evening before only to find it still hanging there and no breakfast the following morning. I called down to complain to the duty manager who kindly offered us a free breakfast in the dining room. We were really looking forward to breakfast in bed (a rare luxury) so very disappointed. That said, I would use this hotel again as the staff were really friendly and helpful, the location is superb and the decor lovely. It's just not quite there for 4 stars in my opinion.","en"

"233",2,"I had to spend 2 nights in 2 different hotels in London and my first night was at this hotel. The entrance and reception looked nice, but it is deceptive as the standard of the rooms is much lower than the impression you get from the entrance. My first room was small and I thought at first that it was fine, not for the price, but at least for the night. However, a baby started crying in the room next to it and it just seemed there was no wall between the room and the room next door, so to avoid a sleepless night I asked for another room. The next room they took me to was in the basement. And not only is the basement comparable to a maze , the hallway was being used for storage for extra bedding and other items making it an even more depressing part of the building, so I also declined this room. The third room they took me to was at the end of the hallway in a quiet part of the building and was fine for the night and I had a good night's sleep, but we were in 2 and it was hard to make our way around the room as there was barely any space to move. Of course this is 'normal' for London, but still for the price we paid I definitely don't think it was worth it.","en"
"234",1,"We were joining a Globus tour and were booked by Globus from Monday 11August. We Arrived at 0830 Sunday morning 10 August after 30 hours traveling from Gold Coast, having booked the extra night at our own cost. After initial welcome by trainee at reception was told by his mentor there were absolutely no rooms available as check in is not till 3 pm . Asked to speak with the manager, a Spanish lady who when she arrived stated"" you demand to see me"" rather than "" good morning my name is xxxx I am the duty manager and may I assist you"" which would have been more appropriate! Explaining our situation she explained again the check in rules but said we could have a standard room in stead of the deluxe we had paid for but we were to understand that we would not get a refund if we accepted the room. We did not expect a refund but an offer of a free cup of coffee or drink would have been nice. But that was out of the question. When we went to our floor the first thing we noticed was a rather large woman lying on the floor down the corridor having a sleep?? The ""standard"" room was fine, apparently only the view determines the ""delux"" rating. After a refreshing shower we walked the streets for a while returning to our room at about 2:30pm and we collapsed in a jet lagged stupor when at3:10 we were awoken by thumping on the door before a ""Emanuel "" like person entered the room demanding to check the minibar?? Firstly we had only had the room a few hours so not likely to have consumed much! Secondly there were warning signs stating that anything removed from the minibar would immediately be charged to our account by electronic means. So why the intrusion? The following morning at about 8 am we checked out of our self paid for room and checked in as a Globus guest which was also to be in a Deluxe room. The customer service agent said that if we packed our bags she would have a porter move our bags to the new room. After a day in the city we got back at 4pm collected our new key to room 1401, to our surprise this Deluxe room was not much bigger than a broom cupboard with 2 single beds and not enough room for our bags which had in fact not been delivered to this room. Back to reception where we were again confronted by the Basil Faulty type manager, who did offer to change our room to 1402 which was considerably larger, when asking about the transfer of our bags she stated that could take some time! Obviously 8 hours had not been long enough at this hotel. She also took the opportunity to remind us once again that we had voluntarily downgraded our room the day before. When our bags did arrive some 20 minutes later the porter stood at the door and literally shoved the bags from the doorway into the room where they collided with the bed and he closed the door and left obviously not getting the tip I had ready. There was an old pair of shoes outside our room when we arrived which were still there the next morning and I mentioned this to a staff member who walked passed us in the corridor, yet the shoes were still there the following morning as we were leaving. At breakfast the charade continued, the food was substantial but the service abysmal, tea and coffee were never offered while there were lots of staff who all seemed to walk around in circles achieving absolutely nothing ( just like Emanuel in Faulty Towers) and when after our first course of fruit we sat down with the hot food we called over a waitress and asked if she could clear the plates she promptly picked up the plate with fresh food on it ignoring the dirty bowls at the side of the table! When we pointed this out she was most apologetic. It is very obvious this hotel has a serious problem with staff training. The only good staff member we met was a young lady named Silvia who worked in the bar on the Sunday evening, she was pleasant, very attentive and provided service with a smile but regrettably it was the only smile we ever saw in the ""Hilton""","en"

"236",3,"What can you say about a Travelodge that hasn’t been said? It does everything required, with the elegance and style of a recently refurbished public convenience or a brand new South Eastern train. For business travel, it’s pretty much perfect; that’s their market and they’ve cornered it. For family or romantic vacations, it would do in a pinch, but you’d be better finding somewhere with some personality. Everything was clean and tidy and it has all the essential facilities. WiFi isn’t included, however, and will set you back £3 per day. Again, that’s not terrible, just be aware. I had a room with a street facing window, which was fairly noisy. It didn’t keep me awake, but you might want to ask for a room on the other side if you’re a light sleeper. Also, there are no in room hair dryers, All in all, fine.","en"
"237",1,"Don't really know where to start. My wife arrived slightly before me and was told she could not access our room without paying for it in advance. She was told this was due to the hotel having failed to correctly pre-authorise our stay. She was dealt with by a trainee who was running the desk alone, and didn't really know what to do. we paid £518 for the room. we needed to stay close to this location and were informed this cost - very, very out of step with the quality - was due to the fact 'rates vary with how busy we are'. How very easyjet. the hotel decor, having stayed in many in London, was poor quality, and I would say it reminded me of the black laquer malmaision look from the 90s. outdated, and the room was equally disappointing especially for the price tag, with for example a shower that was a handheld bath attachment, and in the bath, a king size bed that was two single mattresses and a general feel that was quite tacky. I would imagine its often used for office xmas parties as a convenient city spot and it has that vibe. on checking out, it took three staff to refund our card and put the charge onto mine, with the common theme being, again, they were all trainees. they kept panicking and asking 'where's the manager?'. dealing with a guest apparently. id imagine that happens a lot. use this hotel when you need to stay local, the rates are under 200 and you are just looking to sleep off the mulled wine.","en"
"238",5,"Stayed here after a late night meeting in Westminster. Its a 10 minute walk across Lambeth Bridge from the House of Commons. Easy to find from the directions provided although the hotel signage is low key at night. I didn't check in before the meeting so arrived late (11:30) pm only to be told there were no more doubles. For a nanosecond I thought they might taxi me to their sister hotel at County Hall but instead they upgraded me to a 9th floor river view suite. The view was excellent across the river to the House of Lords/Commons, Big Ben and (just about) the London Eye. The suite was first rate, very contemporary and spacious. TVs and DVDs in the lounge and bedroom. Bathrobes, slippers, full sized wardrobes, iron and ironing board, tea and coffee making, lots of free TV channels. The bathroom was also excellent and sacrificed function for form with a bath and separate shower in a black polished granite design and lots of free toiletries including shoe polishers, combs, razors, toothbrushes etc. Breakfast in the morning was included in the rate although it was served in the Club Lounge, a subterranean affair with no natural light and a buffet on par with Holiday Inn Express. It was quite busy with business travellers and looked a bit understaffed although the staff worked hard to keep everyone supplied with coffee etc. Fast and accurate check-in and check out. First class experience provided you can pay for teh river view. Otherwise you can only hope for an upgrade!","en"

"243",3,"As London is one of my favorite places I’ve been there several times. I know quite well the level of the hotels and did not expect too much for a “three-star” hotel... My starting point was good location, breakfast included and clean, smokeless and quiet room. First one was quite okay (but I have had better locations at the same price) and yes - it was not allowed to smoke in this hotel. Quiet – well, they did not succeed in this one as my room was located quite near an air conditioning or similar equipment and there was a continuous hubbub in the room. This might not have bothered a person who is a sound sleeper but as I particularly asked for a quiet room (both when making the reservation and when arriving at the hotel) I was not happy with the noise, but… this could have been forgiven if only other circumstances had been more pleasant. The most annoying, almost depressing matter was that there was no daylight in the room. Both small windows were towards an indoor service stairs. This meant that the room was very stuffy and unpleasant to stay. I complained to the staff – they were friendly – but could not do anything. To my mind this kind of thing should have been mentioned when booking a room because at least in my case I wouldn’t ever have chosen a place like this. This hotel has probably better rooms with real windows and I suggest that if you are interested in booking room at Hotel 82 London, do ask if there is going to be daylight in your room or is it more like a cupboard. For me this was “once in the lifetime experience” and I did learn something new of the hotels in London: remember to ask if the room is having an outer window. I do love London though.","en"

We stayed as part of a 3 day package including airport transfers and breakfast booked through the hotels own website and it worked out very good value indeed. We travelled in style in the Bentley from the airport and had a beautiful brand new S class mercedes on the way back. The driver Kevin was very informative about the local sights en route and it ended up a mini guided tour. We got upgraded to a one bedroom Linley Suite which was just refurbished with top quality furnishings and was hugh. The breakfast was consistently excellent whether in the room or downstairs and service was very attentive. We found the concierge very helpful booking dinner and giving advice. The bar is great too with great cocktails. The hotel location is very convenient so all in all this is definately our new place to stay in London.","en"

Although there was no room service on a saturday, they still brought up my meal as I explained I was feeling a bit under the weather. Food is available via phone ordering to nearby restaurants affiliated to the hotel and it was tasty and well-prepared. Excellent service and friendly staff that are more than willing to help.

Food in the bar was horribly overcooked and the pint of ale I got was flat and the replacement (different ale) was the same. Rooms are small and stuffy with no space to do any work on my laptop. I really couldn't recommend staying here for business or leisure. The higher beings really need to have a serious look at the running of the hotel especially given the location.

"255",2,"My partner arranged a coach trip which included afternoon tea at the Waldorf. We were booked in for tea at 3 pm on Sunday 24th August. We arrived at 2:45 and went to our rooms to deposit luggage and then immediately went back down to the foyer, to await our courier who was going to take us to the Homage Grand Salon, It was obvious that there was a problem with the booking. Some of our party were ushered into the Homage private lounge - now this sounds quite posh and almost like we were being given an upgraded experience - wrong! It was a characterless room which was set up to seat about 20 people - and we were a party of 40 or more. So some of our party ended up in the bar area. Our courier attempted to resolve the problems and the meeter and greeter chose to walk away from her. The service in the private lounge was extremely poor. One waiter was charged with looking after us - he brought in 4 pots of tea and placed them on 4 tables. Then he wandered in after a few minutes with a couple of trays of cakes. The first table had finished their sandwiches, etc., before we had even got ours. In addition, tea was served in plain cups, not the gold trimmed ones which we had expected. This whole experience fell short of our expectations. Fortunately through the persistence of our driver the Hotel agreed to give us a complimentary tea on Monday at 1p.m. which was Ok, except that in keeping with several other members of our group we had already made plans for that day. However, because of the poor weather we decided to accept the tea. Now this was a better experience - we were seated in the lounge, we had the bone china cups and the whole experience that we should have had on the Sunday - including the harpist playing. From reading other reviews, it seems that our experience wasn't too unusual. It also seems that the response from management has little or no effect on the poor level of service. It is such a shame that this soured our experience, as the room was spotlessly clean and comfortable and plenty large enough with a lovely bathroom, built in wardrobes, etc. There was a desk which had multiple power outlets on the wall at the back of it. these allowed European, British or American plugs to be used - however there was one of each type of plug, a little inconvenient if one wished to plug in a laptop and a phone charger at the same time! Also - free wi-fi was available in the reception area, to use it in the room would cost £14.99 a day!! As expected, the room overlooked the yard at the rear of the hotel and was close to the large extractor unit, which was working 24 hours a day. With the secondary double glazing closed the noise from the extractor wasn't too intrusive, but I was aware of it throughout the night. This was a slight slight negative, but the positives of the room outweighed that negative. A comfortable bed, large room, excellent large screen TV, a well appointed bathroom with complimentary dressing gowns and an efficient air con system made for a comfortable stay. Had the tea on the Sunday gone according to plan, this review would have warranted 4 or even 5 stars. I really hope that the management actually take on board the comments made in this review and actually act on them, not just make empty commitments.","en"
"256",4,"As a general overview this hotel is a good, solid choice in a good location in the center of London. However, there are some basic things that they really need to improve on if they want to remain competitive and earn the 5 stars that many others have given it. Positives: First of all the location, it is just a few minutes walk from the Blackfriars tube station and there is a Tesco nearby for essentials. It is easy to get to any of the major sites from here. The price is also pretty good. I have travelled the world and stayed in a wide range of both luxury and budget accommodation, and yes these rates are very expensive for what you get. However, given the fact that it is in London, one of the most expensive cities in the world, and the fact that compared to other hotels, the price is very reasonable. I will add the caveat that the price is not THAT much cheaper than its rivals to allow it to get away with some of the negatives I have written about below. The staff are also unfailingly friendly and polite. I have made this distinction separately from the service, which does need improving, but every staff member I spoke too was very friendly and made me feel welcome, and they do deserve mention for that. Negatives: The service. Like I said earlier I make this distinction between service and friendliness, because the staff really were very nice, but they could improve on the level of service. Check in was very slow for starters, but I could live with that. The fact that our bed sheets were not changed/cleaned in 5 days, they left us with no toilet roll one night and another night we had to ring down for replacement towels (because they did not leave enough), I could not. Not at this price. These may seem like minor issues, and in truth they are, but when they are charging what is still quite a lot of money for a room they are definitely issues which contribute to stopping them getting an above average score. This hotel may be suffering a little in comparison to others I have stayed in, but this is a good, average hotel, nothing more, which is a shame. They charge for wifi. I'm sorry but there is absolutely no excuse for any modern hotel to charge for wifi, especially one that touts itself to business travellers too. They laud the fact that they give a 'generous' 30 minutes for free, but this is hardly something to boast about. If they want to remain competitive they should offer free wifi, it is as simple as that. Charging for it (especially at the rates they charge) is unacceptable. Slightly misleading advertising. When booking the room on their website, the only pictures were of a room with a bath, and given the fact that there was no option to choose different rooms when booking, I think it was fair to assume that my room would have a bath, which my partner was looking forward to. However on arrival we only had a shower. This is obviously not a make or break thing, but was slightly disappointing and I feel they should make their booking/advertising a little clearer. The breakfasts. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the restaurant or quality of food, which is good, but the breakfasts are expensive. It is much cheaper and infinitely more preferable to get breakfast in any one of the myriad of choices of cafes/restaurants/eateries within a short walking distance or short tube ride away. Personally I think breakfast should be included at this room price, but if not then at the very least don't make it such poor value for money. So would I stay here again? Probably, yes. But I would look at other choices first. Premier Inn is a fair, mid range hotel at an average price, and the location makes it very attractive to anyone wanting to see the sites of London, but it needs to make improvements to stay competitive and keep the good reviews coming that they have been getting.","en"
"257",4,"I spent three nights at The Marylebone Hotel in a Standard Room. Overall, I had a pleasant stay and would strongly consider a return to this hotel next time I'm in London. The room (#241) was comfortable and clean, consisting of a double bed, a desk, large closet and flat screen tv. There was free in-room wifi, lots of tv channels, minibar and safe. Bathroom was extremely clean and had great water pressure and heat. Housekeeping and nightly turn down were well executed. My room rate included free continental breakfast which was very good. The room itself was very small, but not unusual for a big city property. I had no issue with the square footage, but the low ceiling in the hallways and room entrance (I estimate 7"" ceilings) were uncomfortable for me at 6""4. It felt claustrophobic, like you're on a cruise ship. I'm not sure if that was just on 2nd floor or just in Standard Room, but I would check on availability of rooms with higher ceilings in future. The only other issue I had was with the electrical outlets, half of which didn't work. All staff I encountered (front desk, valet, restaurant, housekeeping) were exceedingly polite and helpful. Really made for a nice stay. The location was ideal. Lots to see/do in the surrounding area and easy access to the Underground via the nearby Bond Street station. I enjoyed my stay at The Marylebone Hotel and recommend.","en"

After a wait was sent to a new room that was nice , very clean nice bathroom and was ok very small but lovely powerful shower . during the night the noise from the roon above was dreadful children screaming jumping around , we call reception and they did knock on their door but it only made it worse so we made another call and this time it did so quiter but once your woken thats it so we all had a very resless night . My son had an appointment at the American Embassy at 10am the next morning so we were all shattered. Breakfast was lovely , we had ordered a taxi the night before it was 15 mins late , and charged ue £17 rip off as we had only paid £6 the day before to get there from the same spot .Would i stay again don't think so .Staff were very kind but no comunication we had a reduction because of the noise , but then another member tried to charge it !!!!!.","en"
"268",4,"Pros We enjoyed the atmosphere of the hotel and the location. The Liverpool Street station is right across the street. We also walked to the Tower of London (20 min or so). The neighborhood is mainly office buildings, but there are a few pubs. We had stayed two nights at another hotel on the other side of town, but we enjoyed the convenience of this location more (more Underground options). The rooms are very nicely decorated, the bathroom was nice, and the room has a mini fridge (with free water, juice and a few snacks). Cons I took a couple of points off the sleep quality because our room was very hot. I don't think the AC was working. I was told that the settings were as cool as they could go. We could not open the window to bring in some relief (even though it was cold out, we needed to get some fresh, cooler air into the room). The bed was fine, but the pillows were not very good. I took a couple of points off of the service because the one night were were there, I went down to ask about restaurants that had take away service, or even ones that had Italian/Pizza. I was told that there were none (none!) and that my best option was to order room service. Now, I am not a sucker and I did not believe this, but it was getting late and I did not want to look all over the neighborhood. I did ask if they could look up a specific chain (Pizza Express) and they supposedly did and came back to me with there were none in the area. I went back to the room and ordered room service. The food was very good, but VERY expensive. Pasta for 17 pounds, mac and cheese for 20 pounds, and salad at a decent 7 pounds. To my extreme displeasure, not only did I find a few restaurants in the area the next day, but I found TWO Pizza Express locations that were less than a few blocks away, one being like one or two blocks away. They are very nice for a sitdown meal by the way. I then looked at the menus for the restaurants downstairs and was ticked off even more to see that it was so much cheaper. The food was more than half off. The customer service agent should have told us to eat downstairs. I felt taken by the hotel a little, and I did not like that feeling. Tip If you take a cab from the hotel to Paddington Station for the Heathrow Express (Liverpool St Station was closed the morning we were leaving), the cab fare will be around 20 pounds. Yes, more expensive than the Tube, but I love the cabs and driving through the city. Grab some cheap drinks and snacks at the nearby food store. There's the mini fridge in the room, might as well use it. All in all, I enjoyed the stay very much, but I was very mad about the dining incident. Improving something little like that would make this hotel a hidden gem for sure.","en"
"269",2,"The building is lovely and historic and the location is excellent. Where else in London can you hop on a train that drops you off in Paris in the morning and returns you directly to your hotel to get ready for an evening show in the nearby, vibrant theatre district? As a transportation hub and facility, it's impressive. Yet as a hotel, it's quite average. The room looked like any other room in any bland hotel chain. The lobby was pleasant but by no means elegant. You are paying a lot for the exterior shell, which you don't see once you are in your room. There are many other options for lodging in the area. My advice would be to stay at one of them, head to St. Pancras to take a couple of photos (for free), and then go see another performance in the nearby theatre district with the money you save.","en"

The area is relatively residential and there are many mid-level restaurants nearby. Rooms are quite small (as would be expected in this location) and the bathrooms are tiny. All of my interactions with the front desk/concierge have required quite a long wait and avoidance of eye contact. Breakfast is quite good but if you do not get a deal when booking, you would be better off going to a nearby cafe.","en"

The room was fantastic with lovely decor and probably the most comfortable bed that I have slept in for a hotel.

I did have an offer of an upgrade from a much more expensive hotel in the viscinity of the Chesterfield following a terrible stay earlier this year, I am pleased to have not been lured. There are very few hotels in London that I would make a point of a return visit the Chesterfield is one, the staff and management team are a credit to the hotel. Brilliant, thanks very much!","en"
"279",4,"We stayed 8 days, the location was very good we had a great view over the river. We booked an apartment which was a good size, We did have a problem with the sink in the bathroom (slow drain), engineering came up and worked on it for 20 minutes but was still no better. Loved the amenities, washer/dryer was great, fridge worked really well and was a good size, could do with some non stick pans though for the kitchen. The exercise room was very good and well equipped. There was a funky smell in one of the VIP elevators and lobby on 6th floor. A complimentary European breakfast would have been nice a nice touch. Everyone was super friendly, Dean (doorman) was great and by far the nicest employee we met, on the other hand one of the VIP concierge employees stopped my wife taking the provided umbrella out of the hotel on a river trip we were taking, she stated ""I promise it's not going to rain"" but it did, was not happy about that. They did give us an umbrella to keep and a box of chocolates as a way of apologizing. On the whole a great place to stay, it will be on my list of places to stay on my next trip to London.","en"

Had the experience to taste the Plum + Spilt Milk dessert, which I think the restaurant was named after. The pantry was great and very useful.

"284",1,"Before you dismiss my headline as hyperbole , read on ..... back in june I booked an exec room for our August stay. On the day, we arrived at 12noon, knowing we would not be able to check in, but we asked to leave our bags as we were going on to theatre and dinner. The chap on the desk was polite and the bag check went well (yay! that's why I'm ok with 1star instead of zero). We arrived back at the hotel about 9pm. the 2 receptionists looked a bit startled , but did not speak or smile . They then said ‘ oh it’s your husband’s birthday, we’ll send up some wine’ We politely declined . we just wanted to rest after a busy but fun day . All the while the 2 women did not look up, but just kept tapping away on the computer . I politely enquired what was happening as we were tired , but no reply. Eventually (about ten minutes , seriosuly ) they gave us a room card. We went up to the room(612) and there was someone in it. Embarrassment all round. (room looked awful though! ) We came down to reception. No response from the almost catatonic receptionist. When I asked her what on earth was going on she said the first words she had uttered which were “ don’t shout at me” .Whilst this was inaccurate and untrue ( I did not shout ) it did at least prove she could speak. At this point , having established they had no rooms, we obviously decided to leave . I cried most of the way home as the birthday treat was ruined . I have travelled all over the world on business and leisure. I have never ever encountered such rudeness and incompetence (and I have travelled in the former Soviet bloc, the far east , emerging countries etc where the hosptitality industry is just starting ) . Of course mistakes happen, but you do what you can to correct them and you are polite and apologetic to the customer who you have let down . These staff need training NOW, the systems that allow this to happen need rectifying, the cowardly manager who would not come to speak needs coaching . Please don't stay there !! I love London, it's a beautiful exciting vibrant place, and I would hate any visitor to think that this kind of place is typical .","en"

"294",4,"Stayed here at the beginning of July to attend an event in Olympia. Hotel seemed centrally placed for my needs, approx 10 mins east for olympia venue, 10 mins north for one tube station, and 10 mins south for yet another tube station. Stayed in one of the basement rooms, and at the back of the house away from the road to avoid the noise. The room itself was ok, and indeed quite large for an independent hotel, however did have a few minor issues. When showing us into the room by the hotel staff member (might be one of the owners), he went to show us how to lock the door to the room, and the lock fell off! This didnt seem much of an issue however as door still seemed secure enough, however we barricaded the door with luggage overnight just incase. The beds while perfectly long enough, were a bit on the thin size! I had the middle bed of the 3, and im a big guy. Whenever I rolled over, I feared I would roll out of bed. I didnt though. The 'door' to the bathroom was only a flimsy wooden partition which kept coming off its rollers, so we got to the point of not even bothering to try closing it when using the room. Finally, the room did get very hot overnight as there was no air conditioning. The main door/window opened fully onto the patio which could let fresh air in, however we were unsure where it lead too, nor how safe it actually was to leave the door wide open overnight being in London, so it had to be closed. Other than those very minor issues though, its a good little hotel, and have rebooked to stay there again in Oct this year.","en"

"296",4,"I recently stayed at this hotel in mid-May by myself, and thank God I was the only person in my party. The rooms are extremely extremely small. Its tolerable for one person, but I'm not sure how two people could do it. As small as the rooms were, they were very modern and very clean, and getting a clean room in London is really all I can ask for. You really can't beat the location. You can walk to the London Eye and Westminster Bridge/Big Ben in about 3-5 mins, and there's also a bus stop right in front of the hotel as well as the tube station right next door. The staff at the front desk was always very friendly and helpful. People in other reviews were mentioning the street noise being a problem, but I didn't find it bothersome -- then again, I'm from New York and quite used to it. Its also very beneficial to have Costa right downstairs, great cappuccino! All in all, I would stay here again, but just not sure if I could deal with 2 people in a room that small. You really can't beat the location for the price, and it is perfectly clean, which from the looks of other hotels, is not something you can get affordably in London. Small, but very clean, great location, and fantastic staff. RECOMMENDED!!","en"

There's plenty of shops and restaurants around; the O2 mall cross the street contains Sainsbury's supermarket and several good restaurants. Standard room was clean and quite good with working AC and pretty nice bathroom. Beds were just OK, but there were good pillows. Premises are in good shape, and the hotel all over is kept very tidy. Staff was very helpful and friendly. There's no restaurant in the hotel, but a lobby bar with selection of beverages and some nibbles. Breakfast wasn't excellent, but adequate with surprizingly good coffee and nice selection of cereals. Some bread rolls, toast, pastries and couple of choises of cheese and jam. No warm foods, cold cuts, eggs, fish etc. which left me craving for protein... The breakfast area was pretty crowded in many mornings (it's annoying when you can't find a seat as some people keep just sitting and talking long after they have finished eating). Internet connection was a bit pricy, as the shortest period was 24 hours (£ 7.50). All in all, this is a good hotel for it's price.","en"
"300",5,"We that is the wife and I were going to London for a few days. We had made the trip on two previous occasions and had used two budget chain hotels, however on this occasion my wife decided to fin a hotel nearer to theatre land as we would be taking in three shows. So off she goes and does a successful search which culminated with three nights booked at the St Giles Hotel in Bedford Avenue just off Tottenham Court Road. We arrived in London at around 10.00 and went straight to the hotel to leave our luggage. Our room was ready and we were booked in and given the key luggage left off to our first port of call. The room was clean and well presented even if it was compact. The en suite was also well presented. This was late November but due to the unseasonal warm weather we had the window open each night. There was very little if any noise and what there was did not disturb our sleep. We had not pre purchased any meals although we did make use of the hotels own 24 hour restaurant which can also be accessed by people on the move. The breakfast was excellent value this was purchased on all three mornings of our stay. We also purchased our evening meal her on the last day as we needed to collect our luggage from the left luggage facility at the hotel. Would we use this as a base for our next foray into London?

"303",5,"We selected this hotel largely based off its proximity to attractions and the positive reviews here on Trip Advisor. Overall, we were really happy with the hotel. The hotel itself is very nice. The staff varied a bit as one gal seemed polite but very chilly towards us and another that just bent over backwards to help us in any way she could. The hotel had probably one of the more comfortable mattresses I have stayed on in a long time (I like a very firm mattress). The continental breakfast was more than just a plate of day old pastries too, with fresh fruit, yogurt, cereal, and muffins. Having the Fuller Ale & Pie pub on the ground floor also made food convenient since it was terribly cold while we were there and didn't always feel like hiking out to find something to eat. In terms of closeness to attractions, you cannot go wrong. The hotel is across the street from Westminster Abbey. Within immediate walking distance you can see the church, parliament/Big Ben, the London Eye, boat tours, Trafalgar Square, 10 Downing Street, Buckingham Palace, and all points in between. Also, within 50 yards of the hotel is the St. James Park tube stop or you can walk around the corner and get the Westminster stop. We found the hotel to be a great base of operations for our sightseeing needs. Of course, nothing is perfect so here's some of the negative. Due to its closeness to all these attractions the street in front of the hotel is set up for travel buses to park, so you may get woken up early to the sound of motor coaches pulling up and releasing their passengers into the city. Also, more than a few days we walked out of the hotel directly into a huge pack of tourists and had to fight our way out of the mob. The other negative we had was the fire alarm. The fire alarm went of EVERY DAY we were there. Once late at night right after we crashed out from our flight. The rest of the time it seemed to happen in the morning. No explanation was ever given for what was going on there. We eventually were joking that it was the hotels idea of a wake up call. One side note, be sure your room has the continental breakfast included. Apparently some of their room rates don't come with the breakfast. This wasn't an issue for us, but I did see a few folks surprised by the fact that they couldn't get in on the free breakfast. Overall though you really cant much better than this for the money and the proximity to tourist attractions. We would recommend this hotel to other travelers (and I guess we just did).","en"
"304",5,"We have just returned from a two night stay at this hotel and found it fantastic! The room was clean, the staff friendly and the breakfast, both cooked & continental was perfect! So much of London is in walking distance from this hotel yet it is in such a quiet location. We will definitely use this hotel again!","en"
"305",5,"Loved this cozy and rustic hotel!! Perfect for a great night sleep! We stayed in the first room and it was a wonderful for a one night stay. They had a lovely mini bar, snacks as well as coffee and tea too! The staff couldn't have been nicer. Matt made sure everything was perfect. They helped with everything from getting a taxi to pick us up on New Years Eve from the airport to setting up reservations at their wonderful restaurant. Matt even helped again when our uber driver didn't show, when we were leaving the hotel. He quickly helped get us a taxi. The hotels restaurant is also great. The food was excellent! Both our dinner for New Years eve and breakfast the next morning was yummy! The staff working there was also helpful and made sure everything was perfect. It is so nice to stay in a hotel where you have everything in one spot. The hotel also has a newly opened bar that had some of the best cocktails I ever had. The bartenders Warren and Steven were a delight to speak with and you could truly see they have a passion for what they do. If you don't even stay at the hotel you must go to the bar to get an awesome cocktail. Overall a great stay and I look forward to visiting this place and staying there again!","en"
"306",4,"I staye d at this hotel overnight, while attending a concert at the Hammersmith Odean. I was impressed by reception the hotel is very spacious, staff were friendly and efficient. My room was of a good size , very clean and overlooked the front of the building. After the concert we visited the bar, again an impressive feature and well supported by residents. I would definatly use this hotel again when visiting London.","en"
"307",2,"Booked 'The Kingsway Park Hotel' for 2 nights but on arrival found that our accommodation was next door but one in 'The Admiral'. This is definitely NOT 3 star. Not sure if it even rates as 2 star. The room was very cramped with a third bed squashed in the corner. There were no fixings on the toilet seat which we were promised by reception would be sorted but it was still the same when we left. Door hanging off dressing table which housed fridge. Shabby shower room with poor shower curtain hanging off. Shower tray filled up with water so to prevent overflowing we had to keep turning the water off. No plug in washbasin so unable to have quick freshen up. No catch or lock on shower room door. Day 1 bed neatly made and tea bags/coffee/milk available for early morning cuppa. Day 2 bed appeared neatly made until we pulled back top cover to find the bed was unmade. No tea bags/coffee/milk replenished and dirty cups still on tray from day before. Long queue for dining room as dining room in main hotel was closed although I must say very slim lady dressed in black worked very hard to keep on top of things. Day 2 even longer queue with tables piled high and waiting to be cleared and a different lady pottering around trying to look busy but achieving nothing. Thankfully lady from previous day arrived just as complete chaos loomed and got everything going but it was a real struggle to catch up. Other lady did nothing to help. Full english breakfast very scanty on cold plate and everyone had to keep asking for cutlery, refill of coffee etc. Dining room seriously undermanned for so many guests. Foreign guests very unhappy, some skipped breakfast and we were embarrassed. On the positive side good location not far from Paddington Station and the bed was clean and comfortable. Can't comment on the main hotel rooms but we certainly would not consider risking it again!","en"
"308",5,"I have stayed at the Royal Garden several times over the last few years and have always found this hotel to be reliable, friendly and comfortable. It is in a very nice neighborhood with terrific shops and restaurants. I am a runner and being next to Kensington Gardens and the Park is amazing. There is nothing better than an early morning run in that park!! The last time I stayed at the Royal Garden was during the week of the Royal Wedding. Even though the hotel was quite busy, you would never have known. The staff are professionals and handle volume well. Unfortunaltely my new company's office is a bit further away, but I may still find it worthwhile to stay over at the Royal Garden from time to time.","en"
"309",5,"From the moment you first enter this hotel you're struck by the excellent service - truly outstanding throughout. Rooms are comfortable with good facilities and very clean. Location is excellent, only across the road from Gloucester Road tube (District, Circle and Piccadilly lines) and the centre of London is only a couple of stops away. Value for money was outstanding. Absolutely won't be staying anywhere else in London from now on!","en"
"310",5,"I'm so pleased that I found the Chesterfield as an option for Afternoon Tea in London. From the initial enquiry by phone, to the greeting at the door on arrival to the winder full tea, the experience could not be faulted. The hotel is away from the hustle and bustle yet very convenient for Regent Street, Bond Street and Oxford Street. Unlike some others, there is a generous two hour allowance for the table but we know that we could have lingered longer if we'd wished. Sandwiches, scones and cakes were excellent and frequently replenished. Another of those experiences where you're not sure you want to share but keep to yourself.","en"
"311",5,"The afternoon tea that The Clarendon Hotel serves is perfect. Fantastic service with unpretentious, warm and cheerful staff. The price is exceptional value for money. The Afternoon Tea itself was so filling we couldn't finish it all. Better than Afternoon Tea's in town! Wonderful decor in restaurant by the window. Will be back!","en"
"312",5,"We (my wife, daughter and I) stayed here for 3 nights. It is a short walk (5 min) from the Gloucester Road tube station, and is conveniently located with plenty of grocery shops, restaurants and pubs nearby. The staff were attentive and friendly. My only complain is that the room was quite small for the rather high price we paid. Maybe it is common to all London hotels. The bathroom was quite nice. Every evening we could ask for a complementary glass of champagne (you have to ask from the reception to get it). There was free wifi but you had to connect to it over and over again. The hotel was very quiet and peaceful, and was situated in a nice neighborhood. We enjoyed our walk from the hotel to the tube station. Overall, it was a great stay, however a little too pricy for the size of the room for my liking.","en"
"313",3,"Just as many reviewers mentioned that the hotel is at a very convenient location. The building and rooms are a bit dated but still comfortable and functional. The lobby is quite small although the executive lounge and cafe seem to be quite sizable and comfortable. The staff are very helpful as well. The street- and train-station-facing rooms might be noisy and my taxi driver mentioned there were ongoing constructions for the new tube station, thus the traffic and noise can be a bit more than normal.","en"
"314",4,"I've stayed here a few times in the last couple of months and have always enjoyed the experience, staff are friendly, cheery and helpful. (I asked for directions to Loftus Road and the guy on the front desk took time to make sure I understood the easiest route, but also an alternative option!) Food is good, as is the bar, good location for tube to rest of London and of course Westfield mall across the way. Works for me.","en"
"315",4,"A very comfy hotel in a good location for central without the high central prices. 10 min walk from the tube which goes right into Oxford and Piccadilly. Friendly staff and clean rooms. The walls are thin but that is not a problem depending on who is next door. All in all a very satisfying stay.","en"
"316",5,"The hotel is relatively close to Paddington station. There are few convenience stores on the way in case you need anything immediate. The hotel area is nice and quite. The rooms are small but functional. All you need hides in the wooden walls (click on them to open). They are clean and cosy, the bed was comfortable and you can get an ironing board (to remain in the room) by calling reception- if you don't have one already. Internet access was free and without any communication issues. The coffee tray in the room had sugar bags probably from last year (it was stiff), and no appropriate refill was provided once used. I didn't call, asking for more on the other hand. I stayed there for 5 nights and altogether it was good.","en"
"317",4,"The Location of the Hotel is really perfect: a quiet street only 100 m away from Earl's Court Underground Station, in a nice surrounding in Kensington. Otherwise, the Hotel is quite OK, we had upper ground floor rooms, which were rather small, but by London Standards really OK, and bathrooms were new. Staff was friendly. We didn't have breakfast as there is a ""Pret a Manger"" 100m away, which is always the better choice for breakfast. All in all a very reasonable 4 star Hotel - but the Location makes it tops.","en"
"318",4,"We stayed in room #20 on the second floor facing the street of the main hotel. It was quite a climb with your luggage to the second floor as there was no lift. We really didn't mind the steps. I was very pleased with the clean room and comfortable beds. Though the room was compacted and tight, we didn't mind. It was also convenient having a shower and toilet in the room. Some rooms did not. There was minimal noise and we slept well each night. Breakfast was great. We just sat down and the staff kindly asked our order and promptly brought our delicious English breakfast to us. Location very conveniently located to King's Cross metro and the Eurostar at St. Pancras. Would stay again if we visited London again.","en"
"319",4,"I love this hotel and would recommend it to anyone visiting London. I emailed reservations prior to my stay requesting a room on a higher floor with a good view of the city and that's what I got. A room on the fourteenth floor from which I could see the Shard, the London Eye, Big Ben etc. Considering it is peak season I was very surprised and delighted that my request was granted. The room wasn't big but that's London for you. It was however well equipped and spotlessly clean. The air con worked a treat and given the current hot weather I was pleased it did. The breakfast is fabulous. Plenty of choice and the food is very tasty. I'm not sure how the chef cooks the mushrooms but they are divine and some of the tastiest mushrooms I've ever eaten! My only criticism was that I found the bed very soft and consequently didn't sleep brilliantly. I much prefer a firm bed but I appreciate that's a personal choice and you can't please everyone. Overall however The Cavendish is a fantastic hotel and I will be returning.","en"
"320",5,"Stayed at the cavendish for one night in november and loved it so much i've booked again already!. The hotel staff are the friendliest i've come across and are so obliging. Fantastic location oposite Fortnum and Mason, two blocks from The Ritz and literally ten minutes walk from Leicester Square, so yes, smack bang in the middle of everything. Beautifully furnished rooms and amazingly comfortable beds. All in all if you like a bit of luxury and like to be in the centre of all the action then theCavendish isTHE hotel and i love it.","en"
"321",5,"had a very nice stay at the Citadines recently. We were a group of 7girlfriends (45+) on a 2 night London break. The beds were very comfortable - we had two twin rooms and a one bed apartment, which was excellent as we could collect our ""bubbles"" from the Waitrose accross the road and have drinkies in the apartment lounge before going out. Everywhere was so convenient to us. I would reccomend this place.Very clean and modern. The only complaint I would have was that I left a washbag in the lounge area, and the maid must have thought it was rubbish - along with the empties - and she disposed of it.","en"

Room service breakfast 20 mins late, milk for tea arrived a further 15 minutes by which time the tea was cold. £21 for breakfast no discount offered. On the up-side the bar is nice and table service staff very good.","en"
"324",3,"Adequate room but the air cond seem to be regulated and controlled. The air-cond switches off automatically as and when the room temperature reaches the controlled temperature set by the hotel. Woke up two nights in a row as the room got warm. Breakfast was worthwhile with good selection of continental and English breakfast. Omelette tasted great with jalapeños but be prepared to wait for quite a while after placing your order. The advertised Costa coffee wasn't great, one day the latte has no coffee in it as the preset machine dispensed only milk; the next day the coffee tasted stale. Convenient and easily accessible via tube.","en"
"325",4,"We booked the Rookery for one night to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary. It was lovely - the room was opulent, including a lovely four-poster bed, windows that opened(!) and a lovely antique-style bathroom. We also had fluffy bathrobes. Best of all, the room was spotlessly clean. We very much enjoyed the Conservatory, where we found nice to unwind at the end of the day. Our room was on the ground floor, which was not ideal, but actually was fine and felt quite private. We really appreciated how unique the hotel is - not at all boring and 'normal' but interesting and fun - it felt like a real getaway even though we stayed for just one night. On the downside, we managed to book on a weekend when Farringdon Tube was closed (but the buses were fine links to the rest of London) and when Smiths, where we planned to get a nice breakfast the following day, was also closed for a staff party. That was a big disappointment. But none of that was in the hotel's control. The only things we would suggest are net curtains in the bathroom so that we could have the window open while in the bath, and iPod docs in the rooms. But otherwise it was the perfect stay.","en"
"326",3,"I don't write many of these however I just wanted to pass on our thanks to the hotel staff and in particular the concierge for all the help they gave us during our short city break. Before arriving I requested that they printed tickets out for us to go on a river cruise that afternoon. This was done emailed confirmation as well. On arrival we were early due to the cruise the room was not ready they took our bars offered us the use of the gym showers and changing facility. The room was great the bed was very comfortable. During our stay they again printed tickets for us at short notice. At the end of the stay they again took our bags in for most of the day so we could go to St. Paul's. Overall they were marvellous. Oh and the breakfast was lovely too. Thanks for making us feel so welcomed.","en"

"328",5,"This hotel offers exemplary service at all levels. Only yesterday morning, I entered the hotel for a meeting, carrying 2 briefcases - the bell boy who recognised me immediately jumped towards me and (without asking) pressed the right elevator button for my destination. Even more noteworthy is Mario, the Dutch waiter. We were a group of 12 and we all thanked him for his attention, social aptitudes over 12 days. This guy will go a long way. He should be at reception or a restaurant meeter and greeter.","en"
"329",3,"Stayed on the yacht for one night when visiting Excel. Arrived at 2pm to be told rooms weren't ready and to come back at 3. Went on to the terrace to have a bite to eat and a drink. Had to ask 3 times just for the menu! It ended up taking an hour and a half for 2 club sandwiches and 2 drinks each and cost nearl £50 and they added 12.5% service charge for the appalling service. Rooms are nice and the addition of the terrace is very good. Had dinner on board and the menu is quite good but the actual food disappointing and bland. 2 X 2 course meals and a bottle of wine was well over £100. Breakfast had a good selection but it was all cold or luke warm. All in all very disappointing and expensive","en"

"331",5,"We stayed at this hotel as part of our company's residence course for future managers. We checked in very easily, there is a very efficient process in place for early guests, and leaving luggage in a secured location. The rooms we stayed in were absolutely wonderful, and from then I was planning a wonderful Valentines day at the hotel. The bathroom is enormous, with separate bath and shower, done in a very modern style. Some of the rooms even have TVs in the bath- I couldn't think of anything better! Everything was very clean and elegant. The room was wonderful, massive bed, very modern TV- and all the grandeur expected of a hotel of this quality. The view as well was nothing I could complain about. Overall, the only thing wrong with this over night stay was having to wake up for the conference the next morning. I would have much preferred to stay in the wonderful double bed, with soft pillows!","en"
"332",5,"The last time I stayed in Sofitel it was in Washington DC and that visit created very high expectations and I wasn't disappointed. We upgraded our room to one with king size bed and gained a beautifully large room. Everything was to s very high standard and cleaned to perfection. The bed was divine (you can buy one along with the bedding and linen) - the best night's sleep in a hotel for a very long time. The location is superb for visiting London's sights - worth every penny. The service at the lobby bar was impeccable but friendly. Breakfast was beautiful and very French, which was to be expected. We thoroughly enjoyed our Sofitel experience.","en"
"333",4,"I'd heard good things about this hotel from colleagues and I wasn't disappointed! The hotel is in a great location - a very quiet street near both Earl's Court Tube Station and Earl's Court itself. There are also some nice restaurants and bars within easy walking distance; I felt quite safe wondering about! The hotel itself was very clean and comfortable. I stayed in a second floor bedroom. On check in the receptionist warned me that there were some renovations taking place on that floor. After checking in she gave me a brief showround of the public areas, pointing out everything I could have neede to know. She then accompanied me up to my room, so that I ""wouldn't be alarmed"" by any of the building work. I certainley wasn't - apart from dust sheets lining the hall carpets there was very little disruption to the 2nd floor and all the work seemed to take place from 9-5, so I didn't experience any disturbance. She also proceeded to show me how to work the room key (just as well as it was a little different from others I had used before!). I was impressed at the attention to detail that the reception staff took to checking guests in - a very helpful and welcoming gesture! The room was nice - spotless and well presented. The bathroom was compact, but perfectly appointed. Breakfast was good - my only complaint was that the bacon was a little fatty and not very crisp, but that is a matter of personal preference! The only thing I would mention was that on check out, a member of staff tried to charge me for a drink from the bar. I hadn't had a drink from the bar so I queried this. The man then corrected himself and said it was a drink from the mini-bar - which had never been touched. When I pointed this out he was happy to accept it and I was not charged. I only mention this because a woman who checked out shortly before me was asked the same thing. She backed down and said she must have forgotten ordering a drink at the bar and paid the bill. Not a big issue, but just make sure you don't pay for any hidden extras like drinks that you've not had!","en"
"334",4,"Very nice rooms at terrific value. Staff were great, though the very small reception area can get crowded. We had room 19 which was downstairs, so no views but for one night in January hardly a problem. It was a windy night, and we kept hearing doors banging especially early morning, but this was not a major problem, perhaps one of the fire exit doors needed some attention, draughts sweeping through the corridors. Room fairly small, but had all the facilities required, I think this is a boutique hotel. Comfy bed, lovely bathroom, and tea/coffee facilities. Breakfast served in what looked like a very nice restaurant, but we passed on this, just had coffee/tea in our room....so full from previous night dinner at the Five Fields, just 10 minutes away...though a £17 taxi ride in each direction!! (Restaurant review published separately) we could have walked for 15 minutes, but not in the driving rain and gale-force wind!","en"

It is indeed lovely and clean, and a big room and conveniently located close to Holborn tube.

"337",4,"We stayed 5 nights at the Hilton Euston while my husband was on business. We brought our 16 year old daughter along with us. It is not easy to find a room in London that accommodates three. Our room at the Hilton Euston was spacious and very comfortable (we had the comfy king bed and our daughter had the pull out sofa but she didn't complain). Our bathroom was very large by European (or any) standards. There was NO shortage of hot water. Room had lots of storage in very nice, contemporary cabinetry. The room colors were very nice, tasteful. I loved the heavy, black-out curtains. We had a room on the 2nd floor overlooking the ""courtyard"" which is really the roof of the gym. The roof is a heavily frosted glass so there is no problem with people looking up from the gym. The gym, by the way, is one of the best I have ever encountered in a hotel. Lots of equipment (including 2 rowing machines) and very nice ""locker rooms."" Our room was surprisingly quiet. There was a fairly rowdy family with young kids across the hall from us. We could hear them when we were in the hallway but as soon as we closed the door to our room we heard nothing. The air conditioning worked terrific. I liked the fact that it ran constantly instead of cycling on and off, providing good low level masking noise. The room lighting is great. Our room had a very large desk, work area with a very comfortable work chair. My husband found this very helpful. TV selection was very limited (not sure if that's just what you get in London). The hotel staff could not have been more pleasant and helpful. They made excellent suggestions for restaurants and sights. My husband found the location idea for his business travel--close to Euston Station tube stop and not far from Paddington station. My daughter and I easily walked everywhere. It was about a 20-25 minute walk to Trafalgar Square but lots of fun stuff to see along the way.","en"

All in all - I would recommend this hotel if you were only staying for one night as it is expensive.","en"
"340",4,"Just returned from K West tonight, after a 1 night stay, in room 513. My friend and I booked via Secret Escapes and we had a twin room on 5th floor. We arrived at around 11am, so we could have as much time as possible to spend in London. From our first arrival to the time we left nothing was too much trouble for the staff from the valet who parked the car to the Receptionists and the bar/restaurant staff. We left our luggage, as our rooms were not ready at that time and we went to Westfield Shopping Centre, then took our shopping back, checked into our room, and went out to find somewhere to eat a lovely Sunday roast. We came across the Brook Green Hotel (which had a 'secret garden') and we sat outside in the sunshine and it was just perfect in every way. We found a number of great shops in the vicinity and already we have booked another trip to Shepherd's Bush although this time we will be going to stay at the Shepherd's Bush Dorsett Hotel. If another deal comes up for K West I would not hesitate! I had free wife without having to sign in, so not sure why others have raised this as an issue, and our offer also included a cocktail at the bar, so all in all a perfect 2 whole days in London, 1 night at K West in a very comfortable and well-equipped room which was actually very quiet and we managed to have a very nice rest before our lovely breakfast in the lobby (you can pay a supplement to have a full English breakfast but we found the buffet to be sufficient with fruit, toast, cereal and hard boiled eggs etc. We had no time to use the spa in the end, but I can certainly recommend this hotel, for easy access to London (tube very near) and for a comfortable and relaxing stay.","en"
"341",5,"Had a wonderful stay here recently and completely fell in love with the atmosphere and location. I usually stay at the Four Seasons, and was worried I would be dissapointed in the room size and bathroom at the Radisson Edwardian, but it couldn't have been better. This hotel is well located (despite my concerns) and offers a much more residential, cozy and warmer atmosphere - I was genuinely made to feel special and not just like 'another guest'. My room was exquisite and beautifully furnished, but not at all over-the-top - everything was immaculately clean. Sublimely comfortable chairs, with a lamp and side table right where you need it make this the kind of hotel room you want to curl up and really live in. The staff definitely work to achieve this friendly atmosphere - I was impressed by the ownerships that staff gave to any issues raised. Two pointers: 1) Book via the hotel's own website. I shopped around for days only to find that I ended up back on their own site for the best rates! 2) Try the hotel's restaurant - we ended up dining their almost by accident due to a last minute change of plans and the food and service was genuinely second-to-none. A very nice touch was the phone call from the club concierge the night before my departure, asking if I needed him to arrange an airport transfer or to print boarding passes. Again, its all in the details. Overall, a wonderful experience. I will definitely be back.","en"

The room and bathroom were fair-sized, enough for 2 of us with luggage, and the bed was very comfortable. The food and beverage prices were surprisingly reasonable. But the highlight was the location, on Fleet Street and within walking distance of most tourist areas and sights (including St Paul's Cathedral just up the road). I would definitely stay here again.","en"
"344",5,"The hotel is going for a hip, chic, minimalist vibe (which it achieves)---but at the heart of it is great service. Example: if you rent a movie (Thelma and Louise, in my case), they give you a giant bowl of fresh popcorn. Little things like this keep me coming back multiple times a year. I also appreciate that it's located in the heart of the theater district (which, for this theater geek, makes post-work shows easy). I love the layout of the rooms, helpful staff, restaurants (solid breakfast)---I even like the new shampoo/conditioner/body wash. Overall, a great place to stay for business travel.","en"

Upon entering said "" superior"" room our delight turned into instant disappointment . Room 226 is the size of a shoe box made for acrobats ...you need to be sry and agile to somersault from the bed to the bathroom the size of a broom closet and not lose a toe or a foot in the process. But being for one night be stuck it out. There is nothing worst than staying in a room you dread to return to after dinner....I have 2 words for you : Double Glazing....as we switched off the tv to fall into sweet slumber....the noise level of Sloane street is so present in the room it was as though we had the windows open....or in fact as though the bed was in fact in the middle of the constant oncoming traffic. I have discussed my views about the room with management last night before attempting sleep...this was a poisoned gift...one we should have graciously turned down. I shall give the Sloane square hotel the opportunity to redeem themselves on my next trip over. Until then..I need some Nurofen.","en"

We couldn't have asked for more. All our requests were answered very quickly (extra mugs for guests etc). We had breakfast in our room, which was excellent and filling.

The room we stayed in was very comfortable and had everything we could need for our stay, including luxury bathrobes. We found all of the staff to be exceptionally friendly and helpful. We managed to get our room through laterooms.com which saved us quite a lot of money but I would pay full price to stay here again, simply stunning.","en"
"351",3,"It was a clean hotel. I booked for a friend and I to have a night in the city and the room was so small that the twin beds were pushed together. The lift was also broken and we were on the 3rd floor and no compensation was offered. However, staff were pleasant.","en"
"352",4,"Stayed here with boyfriend for 1 year anniversary for 3 nights. lobby was beautiful and staff were friendly and helpful. took a while to get the door open but once inside room was nice and a good size. view from room was a road and building with offices so had to keep curtains closed didnt want any peeping toms! The air con was very noisy and the noise outside kept us awake most of the night however the beds were lovely and comfortable! best bed and bedding i have ever slept in was lovely!!! the bathroom was small and the shower was in the bath however it was practical and easy to use and most importantly clean. There was dust on some of the appliances in the room and obviously the mini bar was very expensive. Breakfast was very filling, loads of food was great however tea and coffee was cold. For the money we paid i thought it would be alot nicer but it was still lovely. bit better than travellodge. My only complaint would be that staff were always knocking on door early in the morning. If you purchase something from the mini bar expect to be woken at about 8.30 by staff coming in to refresh the bar, even after 1 drink or chocolate bar! the cleaners then come and knock at about 9. by which we told them to come back in an hour, upon returning to room in the evening it wasnt cleaned and we didnt receive fresh towels.

"353",4,"I had a 2 night stay for business and enjoyed this hotel. The room was big for London standards and spotless clean. Breakfast was great value for money and the staff was super friendly.

"354",5,"Stayed over Valentine's weekend. Very chic hotel with efficient and unique check in by very smart and friendly staff. Lovely spotlessly clean double room with tea-making facilities, free soft drinks and tit-bits in the fridge. Lounge area in the main lobby also has a free self service coffee, biscuits and soft drink facility. Breakfast is available at the front of the hotel, but we never used it as the pub directly across the street offered two large English breakfasts, including fruit juice and tea or coffee for £10. The hotel location couldn't be better with Liverpool Street station next door giving direct access to the Stanstead Express and the Circle Line on the underground. A £7 Day Pass gives unlimited travel throughout central London. Spidalfields market is about a five minute walk away with numerous restaurants and stalls. Slightly further away is the Borough market on the other bank of the Thames which is well worth a visit. Within easy walking distance is also St. Paul's cathedral, the millennium bridge, the Tate gallery and the Tower of London.","en"

"358",5,"We had such a fabulous time at The Sumner... it is the PERFECT blend of bed-and-breakfast comfy with high class AND great location. It's on a quiet street with two fabulous pubs a block away, and super close to Hyde Park, Oxford Street, and the Marble Arch tube station. Some tips if you go: Take the tube EVERYWHERE- it's easy, convenient, and makes The Sumner close to everything you've ever wanted to see in London. The pub next door, as well as the one just a few doors down around the corner, are both great for dinner or just drinks. Rent a bike in nearby hyde park (they're self-service stations- easy to use and inexpensive) and bike through Hyde Park and into Green Park, around Buckingham Palace, and back. DO NOT EAT AT PREZZO. It's a chain Italian restaurant nearby, and while the people were very friendly, I found a chip of bone (or tooth?) in my lasagna and suffered the worst food poisoning. My husband had another dish and was fine- but oh my goodness don't risk it. But back to the Sumner- friendly staff, fabulous rooms, and just an overall comfortable, relaxing experience. Breakfasts are wonderful as well.","en"

"360",5,"I was recently lucky enough to win a two night stay at the hotel at an event and used the gift for my birthday, which turned out to be my best present yet! The hotel staff and the location are absolutely fantastic, and the rooms was fabulous. The views over the Thames were too good to shut the curtains at night, and the bed was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. However, my favorite part of my stay was the bathroom the heated floors were brilliant, and the bath with the TV was perfect for relaxing. As it was slap bang in the middle of the city it is perfectly located for sightseeing and close to some brilliant restaurants. Will definitely be staying here again!","en"
"361",5,"What a superb hotel, in a great location for museums and the parks. We received a superb upgrade and met some pop stars at breakfast. A truly memorable stay with service which was second to none. Food was of a top standard, and the view from the suite was unreal !","en"

On top of it all the location is only 5 minutes leisure walk to Earl's Court tube station which was very convenient for us. Since we are Muslim we particularly pleased that there were Halal KFC and a Halal Indian Restaurant nearby. One more thing, there was a self-laundry place on the way to the station which was helpful as well.Recommended for travellers who are looking for good value stay in London.","en"
"363",5,"Returned from a 3 night break frm Churchill regency hotel. Ideally located. done the same trip last year at novotel but this yers beats it hands down. We had 3 rooms overlooking the park. Walking distance with suitcases from Marble Arch Tube. Oxford Street on doorstep, shops and pubs & restaurants close enough. We all went to see We Will Rock You Musical and Sister Act ""FANTASTIC"" both of them, again close to hotel either walk or short trip in cab or on tube. Winterwonderland at Hyde Park 10 min walk again great trip but expensive Gluvine £4 a glass. 1st night we were there I printed off 5 vouchers for Prezzo Italian Restaurant, best meal we had ,200 yards from hotel, we paid £10 each and had nice starter with pasta or pizza as main And bottle of perroni or glass of wine, Smashing. Booked hotel through Superbreaks 1st Class service. I dont often recommend places to stay but I am sure whover you are you would be pleased here. Breakfast Superb. Theres always a downside this is the cost of the hotel bar. VERY EXPENSIVE. Nice pubs and bars 2 mins away. Irealised after ordering we where the only ones drinking beer and wine. Unfortunately is was my turn to pay. Ah well can`t have everything.","en"
"364",3,"I booked for the Crowne Plaza hotel for my husband and I and we were not informed of any name change on booking. The Ace hotel, while it was clean and the staff friendly, it was not what I was expecting. I had read the reviews and looked at the pictures of the hotel and so it was a complete shock to find out when we arrived that the hotel bore no resemblance to what I thought I had booked. I had booked for breakfast and on booking in we were given a card with choices for a breakfast hamper which would be delivered to our room. I was looking forward to a full English with views across London (according to reviews), there was no apology or explanation that the restaurant was being refurbished and therefore closed. I am very angry that none of this was indicated when we booked as I never would have picked this hotel had I known that you are unable to open a window and the air-con is centrally controlled and you can not have your room temperature lower than 19 degrees, far too hot at night!!! Tea and Coffee facilities are a kettle and two teabags, two sugars and two milk, which were not replenished on the second day - very poor.","en"
"365",4,"Just back from a great weekend stay at this hotel with extended family. Had searched high and low for a quad room offering good service at a reasonable price and found it at the Mercure. The room was compact but as we were out most of the time this was not an issue. Pros: Clean, very friendly staff, good service, nice amenities (big wardrobe, dressing gowns, powerful shower) and reasonable price. Very good location, close to Natural History Museum and V&A, good local transport into Central London, close to bus stop and tube station. Cons: No parking and weirdly noisy lift - our room was next to it, however when I rang down to complain late at night, the noise stopped (presume they switched it off?)","en"

Also there is Paddington tube or Lancaster Gate tube station which is also 5-10 min. walking. The hotel itself is very nice, the room is small but we knew it from previous reviews, and it was defiantly enough for us (a couple with 2 large suitcases). The room is cozy and nicely decorated. The shower was good with hot water, the only thing is that there is very little space near the sink to put our personal staff (toothbrushes, crème etc.), but this is negligible. The breakfast is varied: cereals, fruits, vegetables, cheeses, sausages, eggs and more. Friendly staff. Recommended.","en"
"371",1,"We stayed here for one night. The cost was very good for a London hotel and was near to the tube - about a 5-10 min walk to Earls Court underground. We had a room with no window. Initially we were on the top floor - the room was boiling so we asked to move. The next room had very noisy a/c so we moved again. The next room was quieter and a good temp due to air con. The room itself is very small - as described on the website. The bed was comfortable. The shower was hot and powerful. There were coat hooks and a tv if you wanted to pay more to use it. The bathroom was very small, but fine. You could hear people in the corridor quite loudly.","en"

It wasn't clear on the web site that there is a breakfast/food cafe down stairs. However we didn't use it as we had to be away early. Found out on the way to St Pancras that there is a Premier Inn a lot nearer, however we had arrived at Euston Station and Travelodge was opposite. I have only rated sleep quality as average due to some inconsiderate people making loads of noise at about 2pm!!","en"

"379",4,"This is a truly excellent, luxury hotel. Its location is superb (clearly personal preference factors into this...), its staff impressively attentive (the lady who checked me in remembered my name thereafter), and the food I had was top quality. As a frequent hilton customer I had access to the executive lounge, which was quiet and comfortable. One slightly concerning observation: I left a few pounds tip with a note for housekeeping after my first night. I popped back to the room after half an hour and while the note and money had gone, the room had not been serviced. Perhaps not a big deal, but led me to wonder whether the tip had actually gone to the room maid as I had intended (? minibar replenishers, housekeeping supervisor...). Note to self: give tips directly to staff you want to tip, so as to be sure they receive it! But, in spite of this small wrinkle, I really enjoyed my stay at the Conrad and plan to return soon!","en"

My inside room this time was at the rear of the building and in darkness. Managed to switch on the bathroom light but couldn't find the others or see the phone labels to ask for assistance. At last success, found switches!. 'View' out of the window was of the narrow end of the atrium was a few feet away - not good. But otherwise a well equipped room, free internet and after second search even found the tea cunningly hidden under the kettle stand. Why do hotel room designers make life so difficult? Previous rooms were excellent so choose with care. At peak times breakfast can be a bit chaotic so arrive early. Facilities for business meeetings are however good which is why I was there.","en"

However, service was inconsistent. There were days housekeeping would downright badger us with attention, others where it did not show up even once. Front desk could be unhelpful on occasion, and cannot be relied on to give you a room in the class you reserved. Rooms facing the back have dismal views.","en"

Smoking and non-smoking rooms well furnished: dark wood, more classic than modern; very substantial feeling and comfortable with modern electronics. Bathrooms could use some attention/ modernisation; water-pressure not great (having stayed here many times). Staff friendly and helpful. Easy to get to, around £10 taxi from any main London station; always taxis waiting outside to take you where you want to go (but an easy 10 min walk to almost every London landmark). Next to Berkely Square, for any romantics out there planning a spectacular.","en"
"386",4,"We were upgraded from a 1bed apt to a 2-bed apt which gave us that bit more welcoming space as we had a small birthday party gathering of friends and family. We had arranged in-room buffet dining and the food was scrumptious and so elegantly presented! The apartment had scenic views of the Thames and looked even better at night! Our room was decorated by prior arrangement with balloons and banners etc for a charge and we ordered a delicious Birthday cake gateau to share! The room decor was fresh, clean, bright and homely! There is plenty of storage space in the bedrooms as well as in the kitchen area. It is suitable for both short stay and long stay and is within walking distance of Vauxall tube station. The breakfast was an array of full English and continental delicacies. All the staff were extremely attentive, especially the Reception Manager and very accommodating with our requests. We were given complimentary drinks to have at the bar and we ordered some Tempura which was made to perfection and very well presented. The Lounge Bar area had a modern artistic flair with imagination! A great place to stay for so many reasons!","en"
"387",2,"We had never stayed in a Premier Inn before (usually Travelodge customers) and we were really looking forward to staying here. However, we turned up travel weary and our room was not ready. We had to wait in the bar whilst the housekeeping staffed cleaned the room. We therefore felt compelled to buy a round of drinks. Hotel was like a sauna and our room was not the cleanest, lacking soap in dispenser and obviously a very quick clean so that we could get into the room. Staff stretched to capacity especially in the bar and restaurant. Breakfast, ran out of all the juices, croissants and 2 toasters for so many guests! I know I am really moaning, but I had high hopes for this hotel and Premier Inn in general. It was a special treat away for our 9 year old and we felt we were ""going upmarket"" staying in a PI rather than Travelodge. To be honest, wish we had stuck with TL and saved our pennies. GREAT location though and maybe now I know what to expect from PI, I won't be so disappointed next time!?!?","en"

Not a critic as I don't eat all food, but sadly all food options poor. I noticed tuna sandwiches as per the sign and fuk of Spring onion. Tried salami, full of peppers. I get the whole everyone is different and we need to try stuff. Sadly I feel the stuff was not good enough.","en"

"392",4,"Just stayed 4 nights at the Grange Holbern. Very convenient location - 1 block from the Holbern tube stop and 2 blocks from British Museum. On a busy street. We had a large room facing the street. Double set of windows keeps out most street noise, but hotel is near several medical facilities and the ambulance sirens can be heard pretty clearly. We were offered a smaller room in the back, but opted for more space and a bit of noise. Not a bad trade-off for us, but you'll have to decide for yourself. Rooms are pretty nice but in need of a rehab, which staff said is coming in a year. Carpet stains and scuffs on the woodwork, but the hotel is kept very clean. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Great spa in the basement - pool (big for in a city) and nice exercise facility, plus other spa offerings. Breakfast is ridiculously overpriced, but there are plenty of nice breakfast places nearby that are fairly affordable - check out Tutti on Lamb Conduit Street or Fleet Street Cafe near the northwest corner of Lincoln's Inn Field (and be sure to visit the nearby John Soane House).","en"

We started our weekend with a small late lunch in the lounge/restaurant area with a good club sandwich and a special Wagyu Burger, all served with special attention and service. The rooms at Egerton have all the amenities you could ask for, with great cleaning service and not to mention the room service that is out of this world with great hospitality and assortment to choose from. This weekend was a special weekend for us, as we got engaged and when the hotel staff got to hear about this they surprised us with a special romantic ""turn-down service"" - which made a perfect day complete!

I have Multiple Sclerosis and have mobility issues so requested a room with as little stairs to climb. They took my needs into consideration as We ended up with the twin room on the ground floor (behind reception) it was small, but enough room for both of us. The toilet and shower were again very small but not a problem it was very nice with a recent refurb. Staff we met were lovely and very friendly and accommodating. It was hot with an average of 26c that day so air con was a huge plus. The bed was comfortable and clean. Breakfast (included in the price) was nice between 7-10am, with cereal, toast yogurts, fruit, tea, coffee orange juice, water, for an extra £6 full English. The only bad or negative thing was the dining room was small with crowded tables and the fact it was downstairs made things a little difficult but manageable. The hotel is not brand spankingly new but it's charming and would stay here again in a heartbeat. Book direct on their website as it is cheaper. The hotel is a short distance from Lancaster Gate underground station (central line) and same distance to Hyde Park a walk through Hyde park would get you to the Royal Albert hall and not overly expensive for taxis too and from. The room included a folio with nearby restaurants details of theatres, churches, main attractions etc... This hotel is not cheap but I can safely say it's priced adequately. If you want a decent nights sleep a Clean comfortable bed this Is a good choice. Don't bother about people nit-picking at a few cracks in the skirting or bad decor it's an old building and there is a reason for this (it's not bad) great hotel no problems.","en"

Though small we had no problem with the size of the bathroom. We felt the shower was fine. The room was clean and there was a fridge which was nice for storing things for breakfast. We did not take part of the hotel breakfast. We did not pay more for the garden view and had wondered what we'd be looking out on. Our view was simply a parking lot and other buildings.

"408",4,"I decided to book an overnight stay at this hotel for my partners 40th Birthday. We arrived just after the allocated check in time to be greeted by a very helpful receptionist. I was delighted that our room had been upgraded from the standard to an exec with a lovely view over the park. As we were unpacking there was a knock at the door, it was a member of the hotel staff with a sweet treat - a plate of chocolate torte cake with the message ""happy birthday"". My partner was shocked! Thank you so much for making the stay extra memorable. My only slight disappointment was that the room was a little shabby in parts and would benefit from a fresh coat of paint as there were bad cracks and marks on the walls.","en"
"409",2,"Like the title implies, sleep was not something that happened with ease. We stayed in the middle of Autumn but the rooms were incredibly hot and there was no air conditioning! We tried opening windows for air flow but they were tiny and brought in so much noise. We had paid extra for a deluxe room but ended up being put in the basement below ground level, which meant that when the windows were open we could hear people walking past and all the loud conversations from the cafe above us that was open until 11pm every night. The bed in the room was also very small (and uncomfortable) and, despite this fact, there was no room to walk down the sides of the bed. The bathroom was decent. The staff were very nice. The location was excellent and only about a 2 minute walk to Bayswater station.","en"
"410",2,"Booked on Booking.com,had good reviews, and was the location we were looking for,it was a one night stay. Very shabby entry with staff smoking at the door. There was a lift but we did a lot of luggage lifting to get to the third floor. I felt uneasy as I'd never stayed anywhere like this before. In the shower I thought the tray was going to overflow, the water couldn't get away quickly enough. Cheapest toiletries I've ever seen,didn't use them,tiny double and single bed,loads of awful scuffs on the walls,sad towels,burn on bedding,stink of cigarettes in hallway,wifi 2 pounds an hour and slow. Air Conditioning was good,breakfast was average,can't believe we paid 155 pounds!!!","en"

Unfortunately, this time, there were no spaces for us to park in the car park which was a shame but we parked in the shopping centre instead. We will be back.","en"
"413",5,"We, my husband, son and I spent a Saturday night here. As soon as we stepped through the door we received the best welcome ever. It set the tone for the remainder of our day. I wish all hotels could do this. Our room was very well appointed, had a really good night's sleep although my son would not say the same of his sofa bed! Bathroom perfectly clean, great shower etc. Location ideal for tube, train and bus. Would definitely recommend it and we look forward to staying again. Well done to your wonderful staff. We have stayed in a lot of hotels over the years but none has stood out in this way. Thank you.","en"
"414",1,"We decided to stay at the County Hall due to the location. The view did not disappoint and cannot be critized in anyway. However, we were disappointed with the standard of the hotel. We paid £300.00 for a riverview room. This did not include breakfast. The room was very average, a bulb had gone in the room, we had no shower gel, the cotton wool was pathetic, it was so thin and just ripped as soon as you used it. The shower was awful, it was so powerful that I couldnt stand under it and when I filled the bath, the noise the tap made was so loud. The food and drinks are very expensive, but this is to be expected in central London. If the room had cost, £150 - £200 then I would have said it was a good price, however, £300.00 for the room is very overpriced, you are basically paying for the view. Considering you can stay at Claridges for £365 including breakfast, I would definately not stay here again.","en"
"415",5,"This was our second stay at the Rubens, sept 2009 and sept 2012 for our anniversary. On arrival we were greeted by the same friendly, helpful, courteous staff, with some new faces, who work very hard to provide such a high standard of care. Dave the concierge,who we contacted before our stay, had booked excellent theatre tickets for Les Miserable and Singin in the rain and gave us a very warm welcome back. Breakfast is plentiful, big appetite or small. Afternoon tea is deliciously good, just loved it. Our meal in the Library restaurant was superb gourmet food in a wonderfully relaxed atmosphere, Thankyou to Nicole and David for the most professional service. Our room was a classic double, clean and bright,lovely furniture,exceptionally comfortable bed and modern bathroom and if you get a hot spell, as we did,the air conditioning is very good. Great location for sightseeing, Buckingham palace 5 mins away, royal mews just across the road, st James park, Westminster abbey and good shopping around the corner. It was good to meet the General Manager, Malcolm Hendry, on the Sunday as we left ,so we could pass our compliments on to him. We cannot say anything negative about this hotel and would recommend it to anyone wanting to visit London. Homely, comfortable, charming and relaxing luxury. Looking forward to our next visit/treat.","en"
"416",5,"This was our first trip to London, so we knew nothing about the city other than what we'd read. We arrived at Park Grand to a friendly reception staff,and were given room 806 on the first floor! I was delighted to find that my"" deluxe double"" was actually a King size bed. No, there was not a lot of room in the room after the bed, but the bed was comfortable and large, with a flat screen TV in front of the bed. The bathroom was modern and clean with an excellent shower and plenty of hot water. Our room was quiet, and the window opened to allow in fresh air. We also had the breakfast buffet daily.The selections were fresh and plentiful, and friendly servers supplied coffee and or tea. Being within walking distance of Paddington Station made it easy to get around London. There are also a lot of restaurants in the area the from Greek to a steak house. The hotel staff was helpful with directions and getting around the city. They also loaned us a British converter to use during our stay. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone needing a convenient and clean place to stay while visiting London.","en"

"418",4,"We stayed at the Apex in early August. The room was large and very clean. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The prices for food and drink were quite expensive, though. We did not eat at the hotel because of the high costs. Be aware that the area around the hotel appeared to mainly businesses and was quite deserted on the weekends. The hotel is very close to the Tower of London and is a easy walk of 5-10 minutes. I highly recommend this hotel.","en"
"419",2,"Booked two rooms from the 30th to 1st of January. On arrival receptionist are very professional would give them a 5/5. Our room was the disappointment. Shower made a weird noise, pressure was horrible, bathroom overall felt claustrophobic. Would of been better if just a shower, sink and toilet instead of a bath. Beds had no bedside table so you'd have to get up to turn off lights. Our family in another room rented a hairdryer which smelt like it was burning after a few seconds. Breakfast was nice. Wouldn't stay here again - travelodge in Manchester was better compared to this one.","en"
"420",4,"My family and I also stayed at the Harlingford Hotel during the time the hot water boiler went out. While it was certainly an inconvenience, the hotel staff were very gracious in trying to get it replaced, and at the end of our 3-day stay, we were unexpectedly credited 60 GBP on our bill for our willingness to stay on despite the problem. One front-desk staff member was more disengaged, but most were courteous and helpful, and I thoroughly enjoyed talking with one delightful young lady from Spain. The dining/cleaning staff (double-duty--very hard workers who seem enjoy helping, if their interactions with us were at all indicative) were friendly, and I looked forward to seeing certain faces each morning. A full English breakfast was served, as well as spiced crossed-buns and a lovely oatmeal/fruit/milk/honey mixture that I eagerly awaited each morning. The rooms had apparently been updated from reviews I have seen from several years ago. The linens were clean and sufficient in 2 rooms we saw, and the bathroom was ""cute""--with decorative but functional sinks.","en"

"423",4,"We visited in November for a weekend trip to London. The hotel staff were polite, friendly and really helpful throughout. The room was a good size and had everything you'd expect in terms of facilities, however it looked a bit 'clinical' and not very inviting. We were overlooking a building which had cranes and workmen doing building work - unfortunate and a little embarrassing when my husband emerged from the bathroom 'au natural' and the curtains were open!! Breakfast was OK but seemed chaotic. We were crammed into a tiny space with tables either side. It was loud and busy and at 8 months pregnant I found it a squeeze to get inbetween the tables! It was so busy that we ended up rushing and just grabbing a coffee and some pastries so we could leave quicker! It was a nice hotel and the location is superb for visiting London's best sights such as the Tower and London bridge etc. Worth booking if you want a good location but I think next time we'll just opt for a budget hotel - as it wasn't much better at the Hilton.","en"
"424",5,"My partner and I stayed for two nights, we had a double en suite room on the top floor, everything had been thought of in the room: ironing board, iron, hairdryer, shower gel, liquid handsoap, tea, coffee, hot chocolate, cereal bars, cookies, table top fridge, sky tv with sports and movie channels. It certainly felt like a home from home, the shared kitchen was well stocked with breakfast items, it also had a cooker, microwave, toaster, washing machine and tumble dryer, and a separate fridge to store your personal food items in. We would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a place to stay in London and we would stay there again with hesitation.","en"

When we arrived our room was ready and from this point on nothing was too much trouble. I cannot rate the staff highly enough especially the restaurant staff, they were attentive and friendly and the food was top class. We stayed in a 1 bedroom suite which I found to be excellent value for a London suite as it was spacious and the facilities were to a high standard, we loved the bath in the bedroom!

"428",4,"We stayed in the NH Kensington last summer, it was a lovely hotel and scrupulously clean throughout. The bathroom was absolutely spotless and had a fantastic selection of toiletries and other essentials. The breakfasts were fantastic but £17 is very expensive. On the plus side, it's a self service buffet style set up, so just make sure you get your moneys worth out of it! Outside beyond the bar was a lovely patio area to sit outside. The only downside was the staff at reception. I wouldn't go as far as to say that they were unfriendly, but they were quite cold.","en"

"437",5,"Stayed here with my husband and two children on a Saturday night, at a special price of £139.99 through booking.com. What a find-and such a bargain! The apartments are right next to the Four Seasons Hotel at Westferry Circus, ten minutes walk from Canary Wharf underground stations (Jubilee Line and DLR) and only two minutes in the other direction from the Westferry DLR station. Great location for the O2, only one stop away on the Jubilee Line. Our apartment was two-bedroomed, with a large entrance hall, leading into a separate fully-stocked kitchen and open-plan dining/living room. We were on the 8th floor (of 10 in the building), with views out over the docks and Canary Riverside. Lovely. The bedrooms and second bathroom were off a short hallway; the larger bedroom having a lovely ensuite-double sinks, bath and separate tiled shower. With plenty of storage space, a CD player, wooden floors and stylish furnishings, the apartment was a real pleasure to return to at the end of the night. Checkout is early at 10 am, but the staff are lovely and happy to store your luggage while you enjoy the local sights. Will be our first choice for a London short break from now on!","en"

Seriously, the staff are very professional and super friendly. Yes, the Hotel is so different too most - the concept works! Let's start with the rooms... They have everything you require apart from a kettle, however, just come downstairs and get yourself a Tea. Who cares, feel at home.. I did! You have to accept this is a different hotel, but in a positive way. It's not pretentious, and does what it says 'on the Tin'. At the Bar, Nina, Jay and Alex made me feel at home! I was going to stay another night, but it was fully booked the next day.......I was gutted! The food is really tasty. I would fully recommend the Curry.

"440",3,"Visited in July for a 1 night business trip. Great location but I did find the room to be very small for the £300 price tag. Also the air con in my room would start to clatter after 10 minutes of use, and the bed was very short. I'm only 5ft but my colleague had the same sized bed and he's over 6ft and he had to sleep diagonally!! So I didn't sleep very well at all but was gratified when the following morning the staff offered me breakfast free of charge by way of an apology. Fantastic buffet style food, lots of choice and beautifully cooked. I would stay again but for me this hotel is a good 3 star, definitely not the advertised four.","en"

"445",4,"when i arrived at this hotel my first thoughts were wow it was opposite russell park and about 15 mins walk to convent garden i got to my room and it was very nice but just a single bed i was on my own, but still expect a double as i am 6'4 and the single bed was very slim and my feet stuck out of the end.I went for a walk around the place where i was and not much going on but pubs were ok and only a stones throw from the british museum.The good part about the place was hotel was less than a minutes walk from russell square tube station where you could travel anywhere in london for example piccadilly circus ,covent garden,knightsbridge .The food at the hotel was very limited and quite expensive for what you got and the beer at the hotel was silly prices £5.50 for pint of peroni where as up the road it was £1.50 cheaper but after all this the hotel was very nice and posh only down side is there was no gym and i was on floor 3 and still heard noise from tourists and traffic all through the night.","en"

"448",1,"This is some sort of junior Hilton, currently being refurbished, and one or two who have experienced the new rooms like them. They must be easily pleased. The management are less than scrupulous when advising guests who book that the hotel is in a state of dusty, noisy chaos, with only a horrible function room as the temporary breakfast area, and an equally grim, low-ceilinged 'hospitality' room as a (grotesquely overpriced) bar. I was quoted £289 for a room! With no mention of the building works. For that price one could be comfortable in Paris or Rome. Or even London, because Ealing and the North Circular - foreigners beware - are hardly central. The culture at this grim Stalinist bunker is one of 'charge what the mug will pay'. Most are not paying themselves. The place survives on corporate contracts - with the BBC and Carphone Warehouse for example. They may get a better rate, but I question whether the Beeb should be spending public money here. Even if they get a huge room discount the cost to the taxpayer of their executives' drinks bill will double the National Debt. £4.50 for a SMALL glass of wine (très ordinaire), and £4.20 for a pint of lager!","en"
"449",4,"Stayed here for one night for the football at Wembley.. Only 2 miles away so it was a great location. Traveled in by train and underground and would say get off at Hanger Lane underground station rather than Ealing Broadway like we did which cost us over £10 in a taxi, Hanger Lane is right across the road. Checked in with no problem, really quick from friendly reception staff. Room was on the third floor with a great view of Wembley, really nice room with air con and all the usual things in the room that you need. Great hair dryer so need to bring your own. We eat in the restaurant in the evening which was really nice with a good choice of menu on the al la carte or the bar menu. Great staff with good service, will hopefully come back again if my football team make it back.","en"

"453",5,"I booked a suite for a family trip in London. I often stay at the Montcalm on business and have always been impressed with this, but was a little hesitant about using my usual business hotel for a family trip. Actually. I did not need to worry. We were welcomed with teddybears for the children and upgraded to a larger suite than the one we booked. On arrival to the room there were chocolate coated strawberries and sliced grapes which my children swiftly devoured. A bowl of fruit then arrived shortly afterwards. Throughout the trip all of the staff were friendly, courteous and helpful. The hotel is clean and luxurious and provides everything one needs. Breakfast was available both in the dining room and in the Club Lounge. We chose the former and found the choice to be excellent and the service attentive and friendly. It was particularly impressive to find vegetarian sausages and falafels on the buffet. The breads were great (especially the Olive Focaccia which was delicious) and soya milk was provided on request. Crudités and humus were also a nice touch which I particularly appreciated. Sadly, we had no time to use the spa facilities but we did have a look round and it looked great. On our last day we needed a late check out and this was no problem too. I think the Montcalm is excellent value for money and being just 2 minutes from Marble Arch tube is well-placed for anywhere central or for the City.","en"

"458",5,"We were at the hotel for a Champagne Afternoon Tea, this was served quickly and efficiently by a friendly lady who took lots of trouble to make sure we were happy. This meal was part of a voucher for a day out in London and we were very pleasantly surprised at the quality of the service and most important of the food. We were able to observe another couple complaining bitterly that the hotel were unable to accept their similar vouchers which were THREE MONTHS out of date. The staff and the manager behaved with dignity and courtesy despite being threatened with a poor review on TripAdvisor if the voucher wasn't accepted - we were embarrassed for the staff and frankly shocked at the behaviour of the others.","en"
"459",2,"Where should I start to ensure this review is fair and balanced? My stay at the Euston Square hotel was business not pleasure and paid for by my employer. First appearances in the lobby were favourable. Clean lines, minimalist and boutique just as advertised. However, as other Reviewers have noted the initial response from the reception staff was, shall we say, brusque! Demands for reservation numbers and a surly attitude did not make a very good first impression. The next shock was the room. Small would not really describe the 'double' room and the toilet/shower was even smaller. I am not a large person and I couldn't use the loo with any comfort as it was squashed into a tiny shower room. The shower cubicle was the same. The tiles were gruby and the flooring broken. The room was clean but tired and scruffy with the faux leather headboard peeling like it had psoriasis. The electrical sockets were rusty and some didn't work. The kettle had to be held at an angle to get it to boil! The wardrobe was so small only that the minimal list description is the best. That said, the bed sheets were clean and towels changed daily but the worst was yet to come. North Gower Street is opposite one of London's busiest highways and one of its busiest hospitals. Road noise was constant and intrusive and the sirens of emergency vehicles throughout the night made sleep high on impossible. And in the fact that the windows lacked curtains and the blinds let in daylight and the realities of sleep deprivation became obvious. Close Guantanamo and use the Euston Square and confessions will flow!!! On a more positive note, the bar/restaurant was fine. The bar staff were friendly. The menu, whilst limited after 5.30pm was good value and tasty and service was excellent. Breakfast was a basic continental but fine to start the day. All in all I couldn't honestly reccomend staying at this hotel for over £100 per night.","en"

Breakfast was of a high quality, better than expected and better than some self proclaimed luxury hotels.

Everything was pretty much as our previous visit, apart from the self check in machines, which add to an impersonnal feel,although staff are at hand to help.This second visit didn`t impress as much as the first. Maybe because the second time round you get a better look at things. It just seemed a litte more ""worn round the edges"" than our first visit.We also had trouble sleeping due to the constant banging of a door/doors,never found out where it was coming from, but the bathroom doors ""close with a bang"".No heating in the bathroom ment it was quite cold so heating should be installed. On a positive note we really like the area as it`s convenient for everything. Travelling with 2 children this hotel is perfect as it makes for an easy stay in London. We would certainly stay here again if travelling with children but may look elsewhere if going as a couple. All members of staff were helpful. Breakfast becomes a little repetative when staying for 5 nights so variation would be nice.Although scrambled eggs, bacon and beans sets you up for the day,meat and dairy products would be a good addition to the menu.","en"
"469",4,"My 10 year old daughter and I stayed here at the beginning of October 2014 for 7 days in a twin room. It was a bit cosy but really, it was a sufficient size for the two of us. The decor was a bit dated but it was clean and provided all the amenities. The mattresses were firm but not uncomfortable, there was ample space for our belongings and the drawers were convenient. We stayed on the 12th floor and both the view from our room and the wifi were good. I am an IHG member so the wifi was free. It doesn't cost anything to join and the free wifi in all their hotels is a good incentive. The fridge, kettle and hairdryer were very convenient and both Waitrose and Sainsbury's are not far at all (Waitrose is on the way to Gloucester Road Station and Sainsbury's was two blocks away in the other direction on Cromwell Road). There is also a laundromat (Bobo's Bubbles) just before Sainsbury's which I found convenient too. The hotel was very busy but it didn't feel crowded. Although there were waits at times for the elevators, I didn't find them too long and once you were in the elevator, they were quite fast. I was able to print out vouchers on the First Floor at the Academy and staff there were very helpful. In fact, apart from one incident, I found all the staff friendly, courteous and helpful. Surprisingly, we enjoyed the breakfast buffet so much we ended up having breakfast there every day - it helped that children were free (note, it's cheaper to buy breakfast vouchers downstairs at reception. If you pay at the buffet, it costs more). There was a wide range of food, hot and cold, although as others have mentioned, there weren't any sliced peaches. I particularly enjoyed the pancakes, though in New Zealand, we'd call them pikelets because they were awfully small for pancakes. Regardless of the size however, I ate far too many. We would fill up in the mornings so that usually, we were able to sightsee all day without needing to eat again until dinner. Unfortunately on our last day there was an incident which marred the great stay I'd been having but all I will say is that if you're going to offer boiled eggs, just make it clear on the sign which says this, how you go about ordering them. I didn't appreciate doing it one way one day, and then being belittled the next day when I tried to do it again the same way. As other reviewers have said, the location is excellent. The museums are within walking distance as is Kensington High Street and Kensington Gardens. Food places abound although we didn't eat much in the area. We went to KFC on our first day and I really enjoyed the Boneless Banquet, particularly the corn on the cob - we don't get this in NZ. Cote, just off Kensington High Street, was yummy too and quite reasonable I thought. Yes, the Underground is close but so too are the buses. We would catch the 49 up to or from Kensington Road on Queen's Gate (never had to wait longer than 5mins) and be able to catch buses all over central London from there. Overall, we enjoyed our stay at the Holiday Inn Kensington Forum. I wasn't paying for luxury but I was paying for location, ease and comfort. Well done too to the staff. As I said earlier, it is a busy hotel and they do an awesome job.","en"

The room was huge with two double beds and a large window overlooking the gardens at the back, the bathroom again was large but again a little tired. The staff were very helpful, the location was a little bit out of the way but that suited us as my mum hates noise at night. Our stay at the hotel was very nice.","en"

"473",3,"My wife and I stayed at the Churchill for five nights in February, 2008. The hotel is above average in appearance and in a good location near two Tube stops. London is expensive by any standards but the Churchill rates don't quite match the accomodations. Upon arrival, despite a 300 pound rate, we were pitched two upgrades (room with a view and the Regency Club) which would have driven the rate to closer to 400 pounds. We are always tempted to stay with a known chain on foreign trips but you could do better value wise than this Hyatt.","en"
"474",4,"Second time in 6 months to this place and was equally pleased second time around. River view room again overlooking the Heliport had all the comforts and mod cons one could wish for and provided a really relaxing environment. TV screen seemed a bit dodgy but that's being ultra picky. Breakfast was acceptable again, nothing spectacular, but not at all bad. The new Chinese restaurant had opened since my last visit but didn't get chance to try it out. A bit surprised there was no advertising or menu for it in the room. There is a 10% discount for residents apparently. Forget the mini bar, way too expensive as usual, as was the room service type menu; £9.95 for chocolate tart and ice-cream. For that money I'd want the whole tart not just a slice lol! Can use the mini bar fridge to keep your own things cold which is useful as we had a bottle of wine. There is a Wetherspoons about a 10 minute walk towards Clapham Junction if you like that sort of thing. Remember the buses, numbers 170 and 44, the 170 gets you slightly nearer.","en"

The bellman were always waiting with umbrellas as we left. The rooms were clean and even though we were in one of the smaller rooms, it still was spacious enough and felt luxurious. The breakfast at Balcon was fantastic! I would recommend to anyone business or pleasure.","en"
"477",1,"I booked a total of 8 nights over a period of 4 weeks during June/July 2007. After checking in on the first night I was informed my room was not available for the remaining 7 nights I had booked as it was being renovated. No explanation was given to me when I asked why I hadn't been informed earlier which would have allowed me to make alternate arrangements. Surely they had not just decided to start renovating the day I arrived! I was told I could stay at a more expensive room at the hotel - at my cost of course! I suggested they should let me stay in the more expensive room at the rate I had original booked but they said ""no"" as they would lose money! Since the Tour de France, summer holidays were on at the same time it was extremely difficult to find alternate accommodation at such short notice and I ended up paying a great deal more then originally budgeted for the holiday, but at least I didn't pay the extra money to the Falcon Hotel!!","en"

Before arriving at the hotel I had emailed asking If I could have a room on the 1st floor with a terrace, this was no problem atal! When arriving staff on reception were very friendly and attentive, giving us some city maps and telling us of some lovely food places nearby! 5 minuet walk from bays water underground which took you anywhere you needed to go. Room was spacious with a large tv and tea and coffee making facilities. Only negative is that the double room was 2 singles pushed together which meant we couldn't sleep in the center of the bed, but comfterble sleep none the less. Shower room had a lovely decor and towels were clean and fluffy.

Edgy contemporary art pieces, sourced in Germany and Korea, provide dramatic counterpoint to the beautifully lit period cornicing in the vast entrance lobby / bar while Berners Tavern, the adjacent dining room, is lavishly decorated with a mosaic of gilt edged period picture frames displaying contemporary photography.

They have those annoying mini bars that register the sale if you remove the item (even if you put it back) so be careful and the internet isn't free - this is London! Close to Hammersmith bus station which suited us fine and even better when we found the back way underneath the htoel direct from the bus park.

The room was spacious with a lovely view of tower bridge. It was clean and well maintained.

"495",5,"There is not enough available space to unpack one's luggage. The shallow closet is crammed with an ironing board, iron, and coffee making equipment. The bed side tables had no drawers. The desk chair blocks access to the other side of the room ___ which then becomes just wasted space. The worst is the bathroom. The oversized wash basin takes up what little counter space there is. Ladies, believe me, there is no place to put your make-up when trying to get ready. There is no dryer in the bathroom which means you have to style your hair at the computer desk with only a small mirror to help. Awful.

"496",4,"Holiday Inn Camden Lock is in the heart of Camden, on the banks of Camden lock with the market all around, this is the hotel to stay in if you want to be in the heart of all that Camden Town has to offer. The hotel has rooms with a view looking over Camden Lock and the stables market area, great views of the canal, the canel boats going into and out of the stables dock area, going through the lock and fantastic for people watching, it's worth paying the extra for one of these types of rooms.The room room we stayed in was clean, comfortable the usual holiday inn type, with a great view of the canal, the t.v. in the room had the latest freeview digitals channels, there was 24 hour room service available but one main point to bear in mind is that facing the lock comes with the noise of late night reveling from the bars and clubs opposite at the stables, the room we stayed was not sound proof, so if you want early nights prehaps rooms to the side of the hotel would be more suitable but of course you wont get the view. The bar and reception areas are small but cosy, the restaurant is on the floor above, we did not use them this stay but on previous visits the breakfast is ok. Outside the hotel you are spolit for choice with pubs,bars,eateries of all types, fast food,bistro's, sandwich bars you name them and they are all within a few minutes walk, there's even a Lloyds/JD Wetherspoons 25mtrs from the hotel front door. If you want to be in the Retro cool area stay here, if you want a base to explore London stay here, Camden tube station is a few minutes walk, buses take you to almost all the main tourist areas of London, Leicester sq. Oxford Street, the Embankent, Trafalgar sq. Convent garden etc, you can even get canal boat trips to Regents park zoo and further trips along the grand union canal. We like the buzz around this hotel and have stayed numerous times as a couple or with our teenage son, it's one on the better Holiday Inn hotels, with a proper third bed in a room, the staff are friendly,they remember if you are a priority club member and are fairly knowledgeable with directions and help if needed.","en"

The hotel is located in a very convenient location close to Victoria Station, the Thames and of course Buckingham Palace, Westminster, and Big Ben. The service was outstanding and we found the housekeeping to be excellent. Booked a Classic King room and it was comfortable for two people. Compared to other hotels in London, the price was very fair. The courtyard was so pretty and very relaxing to sit in. The management is excellent and professional. One evening the couple next door were fighting at 11:00 at night. Called the front desk and within minutes, security came up and handled the situation. The evening manager, Johanne called up with sincere apologies and comped our breakfast the next morning. This is good business! Spoke with Ms. Soares the next morning and she was thrilled that I was so complimentary about our stay.

The first room I stayed in was, as some other reviewers have said, 'rather tired' and in need of some refurbishment. In particular the bathroom was definitely below the standard one would normally expect from this sort of hotel. The second room I stayed in was significantly better although the same comments about the bathroom apply. The rooms are of a good size however and the reception staff courteous, even friendly. The location is great being a few minutes walk from Kensington High Street, Breakfast is buffet style but has a great range of food with abundant supplies of tea and coffee being served by roving waiting staff. Some of the staff, however, are over-zealous about removing the plates almost before one has finished eating.

"509",3,"I have stayed at this Premier Inn a couple of times before. As usual with Premier Inn the bedroom was of a very high standard, both in terms of cleanliness, which could not be faulted and the facilities available to guests in the rooms again cannot be faulted. The restaurant which is attached to the hotel was very good, except for when it came to making payment. Be very wary if you are making payment by debit or credit card. This is NOT because of any problems with the staff, but rather due to problems with the credit card machines at this restaurant. I made payment by card and received a slip saying that the payment had gone through. However, on returning to the lifts, I was pursued by a member of the restaurant team who told me that my card payment had not gone through as their card machine had been disconnected from the card companies servers. I therefore ended up wtih no option but to go back and try and make payment again, frankly him showing me why was of no interest to me, this wasn't my problem, it was the hotels and I should not have been dragged into this again after leaving, after all, they would not have resolved any of my problems after I left the restaurant, so why should I be concerned that they have lost out. Anyway, after further failed attempts to make payment by card, due to loose wiresd in their other card termins meaning that those payments also failed, we managed to get a payment through. Not impressed with the restaurant and the staff attitude in the restaurant. I would suggest people make payment by cash if possible, or the restaurant need new card machines. I don't expect to be pursued to the lifts again and made to return to the restaurant. As with customer problems, once I leave the restaurant, the hotel/restaurants issues should no longer be my responsibility.","en"

"521",4,"I am not such person who cares about the size of the room! Maybe because I live the most crowded city in the world Hong Kong! If you got used to the tiny size room as me, I would recommend this hotel to you. I feel the bed is comfortable, devices are new and staffs are friendly. For these negative comments on these ""adding-on"", I think the policy is fine with me. I basically just need a clean room to sleep. I also feel the wifi charge is not so expensive compare to other economic chain hotels. Anyway, I feel it is a great budget to live in such a hotel in the center of London! Will definitely visit next time!","en"
"522",3,"This is the second time I have used this hotel. Alright for an overnight stay but wouldnot stay any longer. We were visiting friends nearby in Mudchute. Although we got a room with balcony(nice views of the river etc) the room needed updating. The bed was very hard. The bathroom fittings needed either replacing or thoroughly cleaned rather tarnished. The foot of the pedestal was grimy and when water turned on had bits floating in the bowl. Coffee tea supply consists of two each or one cup per person. Breakfast not very good. In future will skip that and find a café. Mushrooms tinned , grapefruit was the only selection of fruit.jam/marmalade nit individual same with the sauces Eggs had been there sometime. I have stayed in B&B and other hotels and this breakfast was not up to par. Having said all that Ideal location for us when visiting our friends","en"

The staff were so friendly, especially Georgia, they went out of their way to ensure that every request was catered for. The concierge took time to explain and book the attractions for us, we really didn't have to do anything ourselves. The hotel itself is fit for a King, just beautiful and the rooms are gorgeous. The breakfast was delicious and the afternoon tea, probably the best in London. Thanks you to all the staff who made this visit to London exceptional.

"526",4,"Just got back today from a one night stay at the Corus Hyde Park after attending The Killers gig at Hard Rock Calling. I only really chose this hotel due to its location to Hyde Park, and seeing as though it had fairly high ratings thought id go with it...Good move....Its a lovely hotel, just across the main road from Hyde Park, it also has Lancaster Gate tube station a two minute walk away. Staff on reception very welcoming, i was checked in, even though i was a little early which makes a change for some hotels!! I had booked a single room as i was on my own, and although fairly small, it was fine..Clean, tidy and with a great shower..It even had air-con... Can't comment on the bar or restraunt as i didn't use them, but they looked popular so i think thats a good sign. All in all quite perfect..Great location and a lovely hotel, what more can you ask?

There are posh shops and restaurants all within walking distance, but also little cafe's and patisseries on side streets nearby. I had a lovely, roomy, quiet and spotless room. The service was great. It was next door to the tube station, and one stop from Victoria station so very convenient. I got a great deal on my room and will definitely stay here again.

As a relaxing break it could be improved by choosing staff that care about the customers. We arrived forty minutes after scheduled checking in time to ride staff and a room incomplete. Instead of discussing this with us we were left sitting in reception for 10 minutes or more. Communication and hospitality from the staff here is poor.","en"

Plenty of shops and restaurants in the surrounding area. Hotel is very well presented and modern good facilities. Check in staff were very helpful and polite, even allowed us to check in early with a minimal wait for our room which we did not mind at all. Rooms are clean and well presented ideal for a family of four. No noise disturbance from traffic. Beds very comfortable bathroom clean and fresh with a great shower. Did not have an evening meal in the restaurant but breakfast was lovely with plenty of choice for every taste, Children were pleased with a small crayon pack given upon check in.

"538",3,"We stayed overnight on Sunday as we had an early morning departure from St Pancras. The room while small was clean and comfortable although no toiletries were provided. Didn't eat in the hotel in evening but had breakfast on Monday morning. It was quite the most disgusting breakfast I have ever had. The food was tasteless and over cooked. Eggs obviously frozen and reheated. The bacon and sausages were were lukewarm at best and tasted terrible. The toast was cold, soft and chewy. The tea was out of an urn and was stewed, almost undrinkable.","en"
"539",5,"My wife and I stayed at The Montcalm for her 30th birthday in August 2015. On our arrival we were greeted by Leila, the Customer Experience Manager, who seemed genuinely interested in ensuring we had a good time. We were shown to our room, where the staff had kindly left a birthday card, balloons, cupcakes and rose petals on the bed, which my wife said made her ""feel like a celebrity"". The room itself was of a comparable size to other hotels in London, although the bathroom was perhaps a little small. The bed, on the other hand, was incredibly comfy and ensured a good night's sleep. Our package also included breakfast the next morning at The Jugged Hare, which was fantastic. I don't usually pay for breakfast at a hotel, but this one is well worth upgrading for. On checkout, Leila requested to speak to us again to check that everything had been to our satisfaction. All of the staff were very friendly, but Leila was a real credit to the hotel. The only drawback to The Montcalm is it's slightly away from the main tourist areas, but the efficient Underground service makes that point almost irrelevant and some people will appreciate the peace and quiet. Either way, the customer service was so good that everything else pales into insignificance - We'll definitely be staying here again!","en"
"540",5,"Location wonderful - out of the way of busy Paddington high street but a two minute walk to the railway/tube station - a lovely walk next to the canel, and next to coffee shops - perfect for breakfast! The hotel itself was modern and welcoming, staff were friendly. We upgraded to an executive room and were impressed with the Nespresso coffee machine! Room plenty big enough for two and the bathroom was clean and well decorated - a tad small but again plenty big enough for two. Oddly the toilet was in a seperate part of the room next to the front door, seperate from the sink. We literally used the hotel to rest our heads but there was a bar and restaurant there which seemed to be used by a lot of the guests, although so close to central london, no doubt everyone was out and about! Would definitely stay there again if a short stopover was needed.","en"

The breakfast service was efficient and food hot even when we came down late for it. The staff at this hotel were accommodating and I would definitely recommend this hotel to my friends and family.","en"

"544",2,"I had previously spent 2 nights here, on a business trip. I had been seduced by the hotels location, which is second to none. Everything is right on your doorstep. Faultless. With this in mind I returned with my wife for a longer stay, 5 days and the problems some became apparent. Storage in the room is just not suitable for 2 people, staying for any length of time. There is a very large area in our room that is closed off with glass, that we couldn't get access to. This would easily be turned into a sitting area or at least extra space for clothes. There's no fridge. There's no safe. The air con continually switched itself off whenever we left the room unattended. Not good during the hottest September week in 100 years. The TV remote is now on impossible to get to work, be prepared to stand waving it at the telly. Very inconvenient when you just wanted to quickly check the news. As I said, perfect location, but only plan a night or two stay and only bring carry-on luggage.","en"

"550",5,"Wow, Collingham was impressive before I even arrived! The booking process was a breeze, and I felt confident as my arrival time drew near and I received an email from them and we confirmed my reservation. They offered to arrange a car for me, which I politely declined but soon wished I had accepted. I had one heck of a time finding the place! Ah well. It was a nice introduction to the tube system and to getting back and forth to what I would call ""home"" for a week. :-) I arrived January 14th, 2010. Upon arrival, after a long international flight and a harrowing trek from the tube station in the pouring rain (and a bit of snow before that), I was delighted to find my room ready and that I had been upgraded! Keep in mind I was there during low tourist season, so while I'm sure it may not be possible for them to always upgrade, I was very happy and thankful that I *was* upgraded. Had my room not been ready (I got lucky, thankfully!) I feel confident they would have at least let me store my luggage until my room was ready. I gather this from other reviews and only mention it because I really wasn't expecting my room to be ready, and felt SO lucky that it was. It was a few hours before check-in, and I know they didn't have to let me check-in early. I appreciate that, too! Location: Let me note here that the long journey from the tube station to the apartment was due to bad directions and bad planning on my part. When I went out later that night I realized I had taken a wrong turn upon arrival, and that's why it took me so long to find the hotel--- I had taken the long way and the wrong way. It is really, really easy to find. Collingham is very convenient to Earl's Court tube station, which I'll get back to in a moment. For now I'll just say that the location was an absolute gem, very safe, very charming, a great area, and near everything anyone could need for a visit. The area was quiet, yet if one so desired, a short walk (5 minutes if that!) will take you into a more fast-paced area w/ restaurants, grocers, pubs, a post office, pharmacy, everything! Earl's Court (tube station) is convenient and it didn't seem to take long to get to any one place, even when we traveled across town. I felt completely safe at every hour and never hesitated to go out when I needed or wanted to (that being said, one should always be diligent, especially in unfamiliar surroundings) My stay: I walked into rooms that were so warm and inviting, literally, and I was amazed at the size. After reading about how small London hotels/apts are, I was expecting a cramped room, but that simply was not the case. I was in love with the apartment! The rooms were well-kept, very clean, very spacious, tasteful, and the bed was so inviting. At the end of a long day, I could curl up on the sofa and rest my achy feet, soak in the big tub, take a shower, watch TV if I had desired, sat out on the terrace and just listened to the night, watched a DVD, so on. Warmth: Being used to central HVAC in the USA, I found that my sinuses cleared and I stayed at a very comfy temperature the entire stay -- those wall radiators really do the trick! I wish I could install them in my home. :=) Food: If I didn't want to eat out, a quick stop at one of the grocers or take out shops on the way home and a meal could be prepared or warmed in the fully-equipped kitchen & eaten at the dining table. An electric kettle and a quite adequate supply of coffee makings were provided, as well as a nice ""welcome"" touch which I won't give away and ruin the surprise. :=) By the way, I was one room over from the laundry facilities(free!) and I never heard a thing. I know someone did their laundry while I was there because I was doing mine at the same time. I never even heard the washer or dryer, and had to set my phone alarm to remind me to check the laundry. I saw other guests but I never heard them, and I must say I was impressed at the quiet. Even the staff (who were wonderful) had a quiet elegance about them. The entire place is very low-key, with a comfortable yet understated dignity and elegance, with all the comforts of home. It really was everything one could want in a stay. Everything was sparkly clean, very modern in the kitchen, cozy in the living room, and comfy in the bedrooms. Internet: No, it wasn't free, but it was totally worth the cost, and much less expensive than what I would have payed to use the data plan on my phone. Believe me, I was grateful for it, lol. At the end of my stay, the staff even corrected an extra Internet charged caused by my error -- I didn't even notice and may bot have ever known, but they took it upon themselves to correct it and adjust my bill. :=) I wish I could list every detail. I hope that you discover them for yourself! Collingham is a gem and I am torn between wanting to keep it for myself and putting out a good word for them. It was a very pleasant stay, and as for value ...well, all I can is that I could not have asked for anything more. I really felt I was at a home away from home. I felt safe, and even when I ordered take in one night, staff called my room to confirm that I had ordered food. I really appreciated that little touch. When I was ready to check out (Ok, I didn't want to leave but I had to!) they had everything ready and check out was a breeze. Next time I visit London I will stay at Collingham Apartments, 100% no doubts. I'm considering a brief move (2-3 months) to the UK and plan to make Collingham my ""base"" if possible. That's how much I love the place! There are so many little touches and details that make Collingham Apartments special. I wish I could list them all! Finally, the staff -- very unobtrusive yet always there when you need them! They are not always in your face and are not fakey-polite, just very gracious, very kind, very professional and warm, always with a smile and recognize your face when you come in. :-) They were a delight and I give them kudos because they -- from the front desk to the maid service to those behind the scenes -- are really the ones who keep the place running the way it does. My thanks goes out to all of them.","en"
"551",5,"We recently stayed in this hotel for 4 nights. You will not beat the location right next to the tube station at Euston St Pancreas. We walked to Tottenham Road which was great for shopping with a Sainsbury supermarket. The hotel room is basic no fridge but does supply tea and coffee. Breakfast was £7.50 per person and included fresh fruit yoghurt and hot breakfast. It was good value. For a budget hotel you will not go wrong.","en"

"554",4,"I stay in 5 star London hotels three times a week so am very familiar with the type of services one should expect. I stayed at the westbury mayfair which is a 5 star deluxe hotel expecting the very best of service as my usual hotel was unavailable. On arrival the greeting was as you would expect..very good. Concierge and door staff were excellent and very polite. The room was comfortable although nothing more. I had booked a king room but i had what appeared to be two single beds pushed together with a big gap between... as i was alone i accepted this as it had been a long day and didnt want the fuss. I decided to sign in to the wifi but then discovered that it would cost me £7.95 for one hour! This is 2016 and a 5 star deluxe hotel here folks... a real first! I gave up here and went to make a coffee...no kettle or tea making in room! Another first. Even the most basic of hotels have this! I ordered food by room service and accepted the usual tray charge and the food was delivered withiut issue. I telephoned reception thinking that there must be kettle somewhere but was advised that a tea and coffee making tray was charged AND an additional 3.50 on top of the tea/coffee tray charge was required to deliver a kettle to the room. I asked that when they collect the food rooms service tray from my room would they bring up the kettle... yes they could but this would be charged as another tray charge... despite them coming up anyway. I have no issue paying prices for a 5 star deluxe hotel but one should receive the service that is expected. I can certainly recommend several other London 5star hotels as their 5 star is 5 star and complimentary drinks, chocolates and water arrive at your door without any prompting. Plus they have free wifi and free still water and tea/coffee making facilities! Giving up all hope on this hotel i went to the TV..thank goodness they had one! But no... the remote was broken and the battery cover missing. Frustration is understandably now setting in.. Finally the room was very warm so i switched the integrated fan on its lowest cold setting... but just hot air.. :( Very dissapointed on how a hotel of this standard cannot get the simplest of things right. Its the little things that make a difference to guests and why people choose to return. Taking a bath caused further dissapointment when the water was a very dark brown colour... not the most pleasant to bathe in. It would appear that the simplest of comforts at this hotel are charged for as extras and this really is not acceptable for the standard of hotel suggested by their rewarded 5 star deluxe rating. I am making this review only in the hope that these items are noted and improved upon for future guests. If i return to the hotel in the future.. i am hopeful that some of my feedback may have made a difference. Thank you.","en"
"555",2,"My first stay here this month was pleasant and I considered the hotel a reasonable value for this very convenient location in Kensington. The lobby and hallways were more impressive than the bedroom and bathroom, which nevertheless were very clean, although the furnishings showed a few signs of wear. The reception staff were friendly and other lobby staff could not be faulted. I returned the following week, at the same room rate, to a quite different experience. There was a blocked wash basin and dripping tap, which I reported at once, expecting that these would be fixed promptly, however nothing had been done at the end of this two day stay. The bathroom had a sour smell, which possibly came from the dirty shower curtain. A mirrored door on the closet was not properly on its track, the furniture was quite battered, the corners of the wallpaper were starting to peel away from the wall, the bed was not as comfortable as the previous one and the cover of the hotel folder on the desk was filthy and beyond cleaning. If I had not been out most of the time during this visit, I would have asked for another room. It is hard to understand how the hotel management is unable to maintain a uniform standard throughout the premises and preserve this hotel's reputation. The Tara displays a certificate showing an AA four star rating for 2010. If the AA wishes to have their ratings taken seriously they need to carry out more checks on bedrooms.","en"
"556",4,"Stayed here one night before travelling home from Euston station the following day. As usual with Premier Inn, staff were helpful and friendly and breakfast was good standard. The hotel is just a few hundred yards from both Euston and the St Pancreas/Kings Cross stations, so is ideal for a London stay for travellers from the North. Other positives are the quietness of rooms and sleep quality of the beds. One negative on the trip was an issue with room allocation which was highlighted when we booked in, where there appeared to be no family (3 bed) rooms available, despite the booking being clearly made for one adult and 2 children on that basis some months earlier. This resulted in a compromise on our part, with a two bed room being allocated and, though not ideal, at least we got a room for the night. The room (227) was smaller that some other premier inn's we have stayed in before, and with the second bed, access to the desk ans seating was difficult. Have rated the hotel very good nevertheless as we have previously stayed there in an excellent family room. Hopefully this incident was a one off, though it did detract a little from our stay.","en"
"557",5,"Our one-night stay at the Royal Horseguard was a delightful experience. The hotel is located in a busy but beautiful place in the heart of London and the view is just amazing. The building is a gem and it has been decorated gracefully. The front desk staff were very polite and helpful. We got upgraded to an executive river view room upon arrival, and I enjoyed watching the Eye of London throughout the night. The room was spacious, very clean, and beautifully decorated, and the bed was extremely comfortable. We tried the restaurant for afternoon snacks and the food and drinks were nice. There was a good breakfast selection and the check-out was smooth. My only criticism- not a big issue at all- is that the mini bar was empty and we had to call room service for drinks (and still water as there were only two small bottles of sparkling water in the room).","en"
"558",4,"A one-day conference visit, without an overnight stay...and what a spacious and attractive room we had..the Veneto Suite, but equally there should be mention of the conference staff who were exceptional...praise here for Sebastian, who led his team with subtle assertion and confidence. Every small request was dealt with immediately. I didn't get the name of the charming and efficient young lady who managed the refreshments and tables in the Veneto...but she's a credit to Marriot Hotels too. Lunch was well-received by our 42 delegates, plenty of choice for a conference meal, served in the dramatic Atrium, and the Veneto Suite teas, coffees, juice, fruit, pastries and mini-doughnuts just seemed to appear by magic at intervals! It's their job to get it right...it's not cheap, and a high standard of service should be...well..standard. But the Marriot Kensington manages to do this effortlessly, Can I add a thank you to the Reception staff whose genuine smiles welcome every guest. They said my smile was nice too!","en"
"559",5,"I have stayed here many times now. Rooms very comfortable with plenty of tea, coffee etc. Always good to have biscuits on the tray! I stayed for 2 nights, due to attending the England v Peru match. I pre-booked well in advance and on the second night it was the boxing match at Wembley. I didn't go to that but the hotel was busy.

It was hot throughout the stay and iced water was always available in reception, a nice touch. The room was warm but a fan was provided. A/C would be ideal but not normal in a budget hotel. We never heard noise from another guest but reception staff were keen to tell us to contact them if necessary. Breakfast was very busy but always plenty of food and drink available. The staff were very busy but a;ways very polite. The location was very useful, near Waterloo Tube and just behind The London Eye. Good value and we'd be happy to return.","en"

"562",4,"When I booked the Premier Inn London County Hall some people scoffed calling me a cheapskate, but it is significantly cheaper than some other hotels in the general locality but the experience is pretty much identical. We were met and assisted by very cheerful helpful staff, the automated booking in system was extremely easy. When I requested additional beverage items they were quick to provide them, and one item not immediately at hand was bought to my room in a very short space of time. The room was spacious, clean and more than adequate for our purposes. I requested a top floor room hoping to get a view, but only managed a view across to the opposite building, but not really much the hotel staff can do about that. The decor wasn't immaculate a few, and I mean few small items that could do with some attention, such as the trim on the bathroom cabinet was coming loose, and a corner section of the skirting board had been dislodged, but otherwise everything was good. Never got around to using the restuarant so can't comment on that, but that was only due to circumstances. We will defintely use this in preference to spending more at one of the more 'posher' hotels nearby.","en"
"563",5,"Had a couple of enjoyable nights here , to catch a show and a bit of sight seeing, Was not let down, the staff were fantastic and we were made to feel welcome, the rooms (although short on space but OK ) very clean and comfortable the wifi a bonus and although we ate out the breakfast was unbeatable , to be honest only needed a snack/coffee at lunch. Would recommend to anyone and as they say in the movies ""I'll be back ! Thanks to ALL the staff.","en"
"564",4,"The hotel is really good. Spotless clean, perfectly located if you need to be in that London area. High speed wifi all over the place and actually working for real. Registering is super fast even if the girl at the reception is not the most friendly receptionist you'll meet in your life, actually she barely listen to you in case you need to ask something as she's doing three things at the very same time. Only one flaw: bathroom amenities are quite essential and considering the hotel level they could do more.","en"
"565",5,"I loved this hotel soooo much last year that we booked to go again this year. I was not disappointed. they upgraded us as it was my birthday, which was lovely. the bed is so comfortable, the room clean and quiet. coffee machine was great to have and free soft drinks from the mini bar. the location is fantastic and the reception staff were a helpful as ever. this""is"" the place to stay if you are in London....

Thanks again for looking after us so well","en"
"567",4,"Stayed for 4 nights and rooms had all I needed and were very clean. Staff were always welcoming and hospitable. Excellent stay and close to everything. National rail, Tube, Westfield shopping. I would be cautious outside the hotel late at night but otherwise lovely, and good breakfast for those that like it basic, which for the price I was happy with. Thanks","en"
"568",5,"Hotel is an old English building that has been renovated. You can have afternoon tea in one of the salons and seat there to talk. Amazing value extremely cosy place. Its my best afternoon tea place in London. There is also beautiful cocktail bar. Location is convenient in the center of London and in front of Kensington parl / palace. It is easy to find place to park vehicle nearby and bus to go to Piccadilly. Excellent staff and service. If you are a person that does not like something private, this is the place.","en"
"569",4,"I stayed for 12 nights on business. It was convenient to the tube, and the restaurants in the area were very good.

"572",5,"My husband and I only stayed in London for two nights and we really enjoyed our stay in The Wellington. We stayed in the bunk room which was clean, comfortable and overlooked The Waterloo Station and busy street below. We were surprised how quiet it was and how well we slept despite the craziness, which is London(part of it's magic), right outside our window. (Do bring your ear plugs in case you're sensitive) Fun people watching. Not kidding, the best shower of my life! Lots of history. The Rolling Stones and The Who have played here. The history was incredible and added to the warm and traditional feeling of the pub and building. The breakfast was awesome! And the pub food was pretty good too. Delicious meat pies, mashers and a great burger. Super location with little hidden local pubs a short walk away. When we return to London, we'll stay here again.","en"
"573",4,"we stayed here for 2 nights last week as went to see lee evans at the o2 this hotel is ideal for anyone who is seeing anyone at the venue as its a ten minute walk away. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful and very good at giving information of the area etc... booking taxis/cabs and what not they were lovely. The rooms were of good size i loved the air con because it just kept the rooms a nice temp and you could change it to suit you at the time. The beds were comfy and even though there is noise of traffic it did not bother me at all because i was so comfy and happy. Breakfast and meals were ok but I personally think there should be more focus on the morning food rather than other meal times purely because its the most important meal of the day and I did not think that there was enough option but that's just personal preference however having takeaway menus available was a great idea cause you could order in and they would bring the food to you at the hotel which was a fab option to be used. also there is public transport situated a further 5 minutes on from the 02 which was great as we could go to different places around London without having to go far to get to the tubes station bus station etc... we also went on the emirates cable car which was awesome as it gave us great views of London and got some amazing pics there is also a couple of cinemas close buy if you have children or teenagers and like I said the hotel is near the tube which is good if you want to go somewhere in London as everything is within good distance from a form of transport overall it is a great place to stay and will 100% go back there again","en"
"574",3,"It was clean enough, at least I couldn't find any bugs. The ""in-suite bath"" is actually a fiberglass unit for a boat or something. Which was amusing, but not 50 quid a night amusing. The room was charmingly small, they'd clearly carved up the house into as many tiny rooms as possible. The best part was the free wifi from the rich neighbors, as my room being at the back was a little too far for the hotel's router. They would only give me one towel, but hey, it was clean and nobody robbed me, so I guess for London that's all you can expect at this price. I'm trying a different one next time, but not expecting anything better for this price range. I had to wear earplugs even while awake in my room as the high-def details of my neighbor's cough were too disgusting to bear.","en"
"575",3,"First the good...it's in a great location close to the British Museum and Oxford Street, it's right next to a tube station and Brunswick Centre that has some nice restaurants and a Waitrose. There's a pub called ""Friend At Hand"" 30 seconds walk straight from the hotel if you fancy a drink. The staff are quite friendly and most of them even speak English. The room size was fair enough. The bad... there is just a bad smell that greets you every time you enter the lobby. It's in the halls too. The ""Continental Breakfast"" sounds much fancier than it actually is. You get toast, jam and orange juice. The bathroom is OK, but since you can't adjust the towering shower arm, be prepared to spend a minute getting the water just right before you jump in there. Overall, if you're just looking for a place to crash every night after touring London then it's very tolerable, but I wouldn't go there on my honeymoon.","en"
"576",4,"We stayed at Dolphin House apartments for 7 nights. On arrival the outside of the apartment building was a bit underwhelming but once I our apartment were ver pleasantly surprised. The apartment we were had modern decor and looks like it had been recently renovated. Having bedrooms on either end of the apartment gives everybody there own space as does each bedroom having their own ensuite. This is definitely a great option for families travelling. We have always had the one room for a family of four, this is the first time we have travelled doing the apartment thing and We would go this option again. It's great for the kids to have somewhere to chill out and play without being cramped in a tiny room. The kitchen is small but definitely suitable for a bit of eating in for a change from eating out every meal. There is a Tesco supermarket 200 metres walk from here and has the basics but if you want a bigger range for dinners there is a large supermarket at the Victoria Train station and is only about 700 metres walk. It's definitely worth the walk as the variety was great. The apartments have a restaurant which wasn't too bad for an easy meal option close to home and breakfast was good value if you get the £10 voucher from reception. There is also a laundry in the basement which is free, there were lots of washers and dryers. The location is really good, bus stops on Lupus St (which is only approx 200 metres walk) and the train station (Victoria Staion) is approximately 700 metres walk. We were very happy with our stay and would definitely stay again.","en"
"577",5,"Booked through hotel direct for 1 night in double bedroom at discounted rate of £50 from £220. Thought it was a genuine offer but obviously NOT! Uncomortable bed, noisy room, shower - could just fit inside and had to hold shower head. It was like staying in servants quarters.","en"
"578",4,"Stayed here for work purposes, the hotel is clean and the staff are friendly, close to old street and Moorgate stations so easy to get around. Nice looking bars and restaurants near by plus shops and takeaways. Had a few drinks in the bar which were reasonable. All in all good hotel will be booking again next time I am in the area.","en"
"579",5,"We spent there five days and four nights and I must say we really enjoyed our staying in the hotel. In fact, we were only at the hotel for breakfast and to have some rest but our hosts were always ready to help us with the transport, places for shopping and lunch, interesting and curious places to visit: anything! We have a baby only 18 months all and they offered their help from the vary beginning: a kettle to heat the baby's bottle, a cod,... Th hotel is near St. Pancras Station and there are some underground station near too! There is a supermarket two streets away and it is near some theatres. Oxford street is also in three minutes walk and the British Museum so close that you can nearly touch the mummies! I recommend this hotel because...we felt as if we were at home!","en"
"580",4,"You get what you expect from a premier inn: a large comfortable bed in a clean room. The hotel is surprisingly quiet given its location. The staff are extremely helpful, polite and friendly. I booked my room well in advance and got a rate of £79. Great value.","en"
"581",3,"Here for two nights. The reception area is clean and welcoming. The chap checking us in was really good at his job. The room is small but functional and well maintained. We got a corner room, which on the plan looks to be smaller than most so I imagine that we were just unlucky ( despite paying a small fortune for the privilege!). The showeroom is fantastic- there's no bath but the shower is truly a) huge and b) awesome. Location is great if you're travelling or want to be able to access the hustle and bustle of central London easily and quickly, without having to endure it. I would stay again but only if I could secure a bigger room.","en"
"582",5,"I stayed here for one night and from the chap that helped me out of my taxi, to the lady that checked me in and the chap that brought my room service - I found my experience to be absolutely perfect. My room was beautiful and elegant, and I will definitely stay here again.","en"

"584",5,"This is a super Townhouse hotel in Marylebone - just metres from Marylebone station and a very short walk to Baker Street station. Our room was at the back of the hotel and did not have a view - other than office workers at their desks. However, the room (201) was lovely and the interior design was excellent. My only gripe was the rather naff mannequin in the room which got in the way but apparently, this is another 'trademark' of the chain and is in every room in every hotel. The bathroom is small but again, very well presented and the standard of the finishes is the best I've ever encountered in a hotel. Breakfast was great with a wide choice - even for veggies but the English Breakfast tea was appalling - I know it was a posh mix, especially blended for the hotel but I just wanted my standard Yorkshire brew rather than something malty and herby. The bar is light and comfortable and decked out in the other hotel theme of cricket and cricketers and its very busy - mostly non-residents coming in for afternoon high tea and drinks. The service is very good at the bar and the nibbles are top notch. Did not dine in the Potting Shed but the menu looked small but interesting. The furnishings in the lounge are truly scrumptious and the Christmas tree finished off the look wonderfully. Would stay again and the desk staff have already updated our profile so that we'll get a view next time.","en"
"585",4,"Conveniently located if you need to hop in and out of London quickly and much better than other nearby hotels, is a good place to stay if you can get a sub £150 room. If you are looking for a fancy place stay away and don't bother trying the restaurant, not worthy for breakfast, lunch or dinner. The place is clean, the staff is nice and the rooms are well appointed. Enjoy you stay.","en"
"586",4,"This is a beautiful hotel, in a great location ideally located to many london attractions. We visted the hotel for chamagne afernoon tea. It was a very slow start which we waited 30 min for our champagne, followed by another 15 minute wait for our sandwiches etc and the we waited another 10 mins,after that for our tea. Which by this point we got a little impatient. But once all the food/tea had arrived it was fantastic, beautiful flavours with a good choice of sandwich, lovely warm scones and pretty delicate desserts. If it wasn't for the service I would definitely recommend but the slow start spoilt it a little although the staff were very friendly and smiley. I have done many afternoon teas in london and this is one of the nicer settings, locations but do not think I would return due to the service in the beginning.","en"
"587",5,"We only stayed one night, ( we were going to the theatre) but we certainly packed a lot in. The check in time was 3pm, but we got there early to drop off our bags before having a look round. When we went to the desk our room was ready, it was only midday. Brilliant, we went to our room , which was a quite twin, with tea/coffee facilities and dropped our bags and went on our way. the hotel staff were very friendly and every one had a smile for you. Breakfast was a self service event and for any one with a big appetite, well after that breakfast you should not feel hungry. There was no pressure to eat quickly, and the choices were fantastic. You will have a memorable time if you stay here, whether for one or five nights. ENJOY.","en"
"588",5,"We stayed 5 nights at this hotel and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The staff were very very helpful and everything was done with a smile, especially at breakfast even when they were very busy. Our teenage daughter slept on the bed settee in the room which she found very comfortable. The room and bathroom were very clean with a good shower and great towels. Breakfast was very good with a wide selection of choice - fresh fruit, cereals, continental meats/cheese and hot food (the baguettes were great!!). While it's not in the centre of London, it is next door to the docklands light railway and overground station. It could have done with a bit more wardrobe space, but this certainly did not detract from our experience of the hotel and it would be our first choice when staying in London again. Free internet access would also be good, although there are a couple of pc's in the lobby for guests to use free of charge.","en"

The hotel has an excellent restaurant and breakfast was excellent . The minuses are the rooms are so small , not very well maintained and WIFI was not much relaible but at 10 pounds a night for 3 nights was ok . Also check the offers they dispaly along the place as they package breakfast and WIFI together in the hotel not on the site","en"
"590",4,"At a reasonable rate, just round the corner from Bayswater tube station, the room was small, but all I was doing was sleeping and showering. Situated in a quiet neighbourhood, noise was no problem, 24 hr manned reception was an advantage as I left early in the morning. 0430 walking to Paddington, no problem, felt completely safe. This hotel will be on my list to use again.","en"
"591",3,"London is an expensive city, so for our long weekend vacation we were researching cheap but clean and nice hotels located no more than 20 minutes away by public transport from the main attractions. At the last minute we decided to stay close to Victoria Station (we were flying into Gatwick Airport, 30 minutes by train from Victoria), and pay the price for the location. From Victoria, we walked for 10-15 minutes to the hotel, but it is also possible to ride the bus or the tube to Pilmico, aprox. 1 block away from the hotel. The hotel was clean and the staff helpful, the room was very small but fine for what we do in a hotel when vacationing: just sleep. The breakfast was abundant and good, although the menu was the same every day. By staying in this location we were able to ride the bus and the tube to the main attractions and not worry about tickets or cabs, just bought the Oyster card at the airport and had peace of mind. I would recommend the hotel for one or two nights maximum.","en"
"592",3,"We stayed two days in London. We chose this hotel because of its location on the south bank of the Thames, at the south side of Westminster Bridge. Easy walk to the Underground across the bridge. Rooms were nice but lighting poor and bathroom amenities limited. Staff very helpful. Overall, a nice hotel but you pay a lot for what you get.","en"
"593",3,"I must praise the Springfield Hotel where i stayed for 4 nights. It is a B+B hotel. The staff were friendly. The breakfast was very good with excellent sausages. The room was warm, but not too warm, with a lovely ensuite shower. TV had the 5 UK channels. Beds were comfortable and clean, and were made up each day. Any towels used were changed daily. Location was very easy and quick for access to the tube at Paddington. Check out is 11am but i had some time to kill before i had to go for my train and i sat in the reception sitting room watching the large TV, very comfortable. The only downside was one that they can't help - the traffic noise. Sussex Gardens can be a noisy road, but the same would be true for any of the many B&Bs on this road. Thumbs up.","en"
"594",5,"It was our first visit to London. We were a bit afraid of what kind of hotel we will get, because we heard quite negative things about London and its hotel accomodations. We arrived late in the evening and we had no problem finding the hotel - the bus stop is right in front of it. There are a lot of bus lines driving frequently to the city centre from this area. It takes about 20mins to get to the centre and the tourist attractions. The staff was very very friendly, helpful and they even talked to us in German. We were very surprised- in a positive way when we saw our room. It was modern, the bathroom was new and all in all everything was really clean. We felt secure in the area and there were not so much tourists around - which was really good to see also this part of London. The English breakfast (if you like sausage and meat in the morning) was good, the restaurant looked quite interesting and we regret, that we did not had a dinner there. All in all we were glad to stay in this hotel and we can recommend it and would also book it when we will be going next time to London.","en"
"595",2,"Less than a minute's walk from Paddington Station! The hotel lobby and hallways were very clean, and the staff very friendly and helpful. The room was very clean as well, and we also had plenty of hot water for showers. Breakfast was excellent, and was pleasantly surprised to be able to have a ""Full English"". The breakfast was served quickly, and again, the staff were very friendly and helpful. The only gripe I have of the place, is that the walls and room door seem rather thin, and we could hear the couple in the other room quite well, as well as people walking on the floor above us. It would be nice if they could somehow put in a bit of sound insulation, the next time they renovate the rooms. Still, the cleanliness, location, and breakfast will make me consider getting a room here, again.","en"

"599",2,"We stayed in this hotel in September, as a short stopover from Australia. I cannot thank enough General Manager of the hotel Mr. Volkan Reisoglu and Guest Relations Manager Maria Yakunina for their great service. We are light sleepers, and we knew the location of the hotel is in a very busy road. They found the most quiet room at the back of the hotel that would meet all of our needs. They even kept for us this particular room. We have arrived early, at 9 a.m. Room was ready in spite of early check in. It was extremely important for us after 24 hours flight. In addition, Maria has booked for us ""sold out"" tickets to the theatre. My husband left sunglasses in the room and Maria sent them to Sydney free of charge. My tips for travellers: let the hotel know about your specific needs before arrival: usually they do everything they could to accommodate your requiest.","en"

"602",3,"We had a 2 bedroom apartment, the second room being only large enough for a single bed. The second single bed was in the main room containing the kitchen and TV so we had to juggle the sleeping children at night when we had finished in the main room. This might suit other families / groups but was awkward for us. The bathroom was compact but good. The double bed was hard and uncomfortable but the room we had was at the back of the building and was extremely quiet. Very clean. No bottle opener or wine glasses which you would expect in a room with a kitchen. Oven worked well. Helpful staff.","en"
"603",5,"We stayed on the third floor in a twin bed room. The room was larger than I expected for central London and the bathroom was huge! Our view was the courtyard and nothing to write home about. The linens were lovely, and the mattress was adequate. The hotel staff was super friendly and accommodating. We asked for extra towels and they were brought right up. The only criticism was that the concierge wasn't very knowledgeable, available or helpful. The gym was medium sized but had everything I needed. We used the gym every day. It was clean, had fresh towels, water and wipes for the machines. The hotel is a bit of a labyrinth with connecting buildings and stairs so be mindful of bringing your own bulky luggage to your room as it may be difficult for some. The location is a little north of the area we wanted to spend most of our time in, but the tube station is steps away from the hotel entrance and there are multiple bus routes that can easily accommodate after midnight when the tube shuts down. Also, lots of coffee shops, grocery stores, quick bites and a pharmacy are literally on the same block as the hotel. Although we didn't have time to go, the hotel seemed to have a very happening restaurant and bar with lovely Jazz music playing that we heard as we walked through the small but well appointed lobby area. Free wifi as well.","en"
"604",5,"Internet service in rooms and throughout the hotel is very, very bad. Only a few times each day was there enough bandwidth to even use it. The connection is fine, but it does not support the traffic. Honestly, when riding the London underground I could connect to Virgin mobile when the train stopped and pull down a page faster than at the Corinthia. I complained, and the manager seemed to care, although he mostly implied it was working fine for everyone else?? Forget about skype or facetime calls to friends back home and you could never upload a photo in a e-mail, difficult just sending an e-mail. All the other fantastic reviews people have offered are true and that needs no more comment on my part. But since many people that use TripAdvisor to find this hotel initially will continue to use TripAdvisor for restaurants or activities it may be worth mentioning you will be sitting in the Starbucks near the hotel to surf the internet. I think for $600 per night the internet service should be better. Be careful with the excuse the manager will offer in response to my comments - we tried PC, IPad, Iphones... nothing worked well at the Corinthia but everything worked fine at Starbucks, you can do the math.","en"
"605",5,"We were visiting Europe for our third anniversary starting in London and visiting few other countries. And boy, did we start right ? I had exchanged some emails with the manager few weeks before arriving and informed them of the special occasion. Reception was extremely pleasant and offered us an upgrade. Room was quiet spacious, especially by the European standards. Housekeeping was immaculate. If there was a let down, it was the room service. Food wasn't quiet up to what one would expect from a hotel of this caliber. But their overall hospitality more than made up for it. Highly recommended !!","en"

"609",4,"We chose to stay here last minute - literally and check-in was quick, efficient and easy, the receptionist was very friendly and warm, it was a pleasure to have such a warm welcome. We were given a choice of floors, 2nd 3rd or 6th but were not advised of renovation works on the floor we chose. Surely this should be stated when given the option? So we get in, settle, return to the bar for a drink before crashing after a long journey from Devon. Our nap was disturbed by the refurbishment work, constant drilling and knocking. We mentioned this to customer services who were apologetic and we were moved with no hassle at all. Cannot fault the staff for efficiency and professionalism throughout. The room we moved to was fantastic and well away from the noise, well decorated, modern and clean. Nice little touch in the bathrooms for screening out the whole room but allowing some natural light to still get through. We spent only a matter of hours in our room but frequented the bar which was always a welcome stop off before and after our journey out. The drinks here are standard prices. Remember to book your room before as the ""walk in"" price is substantially more than you can get it for elsewhere. Overall Comfortable Room, Good Facilities, Excellent Location and Friendly Staff.","en"

"617",5,"Where to start with this wonderful hotel? I guess the first, although not the most important, thing is its central location – an easy 5 minute stroll from Marble Arch tube station and close to many of London’s attractions and theatres. Next, the building itself: on our first visit about 18 months ago it was undergoing renovation. This has now been completed and although the main structure is obviously old, once inside the décor is modern and tasteful with an air of quiet opulence. The public areas and the bedrooms are immaculately clean and in the bathroom we appreciated hot water without the long wait you get in some older buildings. The air conditioning is unobtrusive and, with a room to the rear of the hotel, we were able to open the sash window without too much traffic noise. The only small complaint is that because the hotel is a conversion from a private house some rooms are rather undersized and in No 405 it was impossible to sit comfortably on the dressing table chair as the bed was too close. But, Hey! Who cares – we just sat on the bed to use the mirror. We had afternoon tea on our first day as we had arranged to meet some family there. Our recommendation is to order one portion for every two people – any more and you’ll be asking for a doggy bag. Similarly breakfast provides enough volume and variety to keep you going all day. Regretfully our schedules have never allowed time to visit either of the restaurants for dinner but we hope to do so on a future stay. We did, however, have a bar meal on our first night and this did not disappoint. Now to the most important element of any hotel stay – the staff. The welcome is warm, cheerful and efficient; the domestic staff are similarly cheerful and professional as are the bartenders and waiters/waitresses. We reckon a good hotel keeps its staff and we recognised many of the faces from our previous visit. More importantly, the faces recognised us and their warm greetings and attentive service made us feel so at home. On our second and last night we saw The Wizard of Oz – a magical experience – and our whole visit was made magical by our stay at the Mostyn. There is now no other hotel for us when we visit London.","en"
"618",4,"A large party of us, with small children stayed here over the weekend. After leaving our luggage at the hotel early, we had a very full day in London before making our way back to check-in. Check-in was very easy, and we were given large family rooms (one double bed and a fold out sofa bed) which easily suited our needs, before we decided to look for somewhere to eat. As the hotel didn't have a restaurant, the staff very kindly provided take-away menus and allowed us to bring take-away food into the bar area, where the children could eat in front of the large telly (which pleased them) and we could still get drinks from the bar. The rooms were very clean and comfortable, and there were no queue's for breakfast the next day, plenty of choice and the food was very nice too. We were told the breakfast was continental, but there was also a choice of english breakfast available too, which was great. The only slight annoyance was the noise levels from other guests, returning in the early hours of the morning being drunk and loud, which kept waking the children","en"
"619",2,"Where to begin? I now know that my expectations for the Atheneum were way too high, but based on reviews here and from Frommer's London with Kids I felt confident in this hotel going in. My complaints are both general in nature and specific, and in truth are too numerous to enumerate here, but I'll list a few. First, we reserved one of the family apartments around the corner, which we thought was going to be nice and quiet. Very, very wrong. Aside from the street noise all night, each of the three mornings we were there the garbage truck arrived at 4:30am to collect the hotel garbage and recycling. The crashing of the refuse and the engine noise/backup beeping lasted 10-15 minutes. Then the toilet in one of the bathrooms flushed with no discernable pattern: sometimes it was after 1 pressing of the lever, sometimes it took 3-5 presses, and sometimes it didn't flush at all. Lastly, and most dishearteningly for a hotel which purports to be a family-centered hotel, the management unwisely booked a group of 50 young urban professional/business types who were given breakfast privileges from 7:00 to 8:30am each morning for 5 weeks. Everyone else who was not a part of this elite group was asked to wait it the bar area until they finished! Even latecomers from this group were given tables while others were forced to wait. After I complained (much to the embarrassment of my 3 kids) the maitre d' and front desk staff awoke from their dream that everything was going perfectly well as my family and at least 2 other small groups of hungry, paying hotel guests waited as the important businessmen and women came and went as they pleased. Needless to say, we ordered room service breakfast the next two mornings and enjoyed cold waffles and eggs in our rooms. The bottom line on this place: they seem to think that having a children's concierge and a playroom with stuffed animals is all it takes to call a hotel ""family friendly."" It doesn't. They give off the feeling that they're in over their heads and not as on top of things as they should be.","en"
"620",5,"When I come to London I always choose new or renovated hotels as you never know what you will get. Park Plaza has great location short walk from Waterloo station and is well built new business hotel with all modern amenities one can need. I upgraded to Iconic one bedroom suite and the room was huge with separate living room, great bathroom and super comfortable bedroom. What was truly memorable was the view of the Houses of Parliament. I have seen some views in my life, but this was one surely on the top of the list. Otherwise as with any huge business hotel, the service was fine, nothing to remember so if you expect personal service, this is not your hotel.","en"

I originally booked a standard guest room, after a quick phone call to reception I was upgraded to executive room for 25GBP and the helpful lady also arranged a cake and fruit for us in the room with a small. Location is really good, minutes walk fro Holborn. The hotel itself seems new and fresh. Thank-you to all at the Doubletree.","en"
"622",1,"Visited midweek and had twin room for friend and myself. £100 a night gets you a dirty brown room with sink and a shared toilet. No shower/bath. Dirty old carpets and ancient brown curtains and bed cover, it's truly wretched and makes me embarrassed that this is what foreign visitors have to contend with. The 'breakfast' was choice of full English or continental. As a veggie i chose continental, though what continent this alludes to i'll never know as I was given 3 slices of white toast and instant coffee! Really? Is this what we've come to expect for £100 a night? The massive signs saying 'No refunds under any circumstance' show that refunds are probably the most requested item there. Just awful.","en"

Staff very pleasant and attentive.","en"

"626",5,"After reading some reviews about The Rubens on this website, I decided to give it a try. I am very happy to say that this is so far my favorite hotel for the price I usually book for - usually no more than 200 pounds. I am a minimalist and many people complain about the rooms decor. True, the hotel is a bit special and rooms seems to be individually decorated. I really like this idea, as no stay is the same. I came across description of ""the friendliest personnel ever"" and was a bit skeptical. Can personnel really make a difference? When you enter this hotel, you will find out. The personnel makes a huge difference! I was accepted in a kind, open manner and they were willing to help me out with whatever. If hotel is not full, you will probably be able to choose a color scheme of your room, so just ask when checking in. Now about the room. The room is London standard size (that is, quite small), but I didn't miss a thing. The bed was very comfortable. Apart from towels, bathrobes are provided, which makes a stay very cosy. In the bathroom, you will find a fresh flower for you, a nice touch. Very important (for me, at least), I found a big (!) tea cup together with the tea boiler AND a tea kettle. Wow! No smallish cappuccino cups for tea boiling! Makes all the difference. The tea selection is upscale as well. No cheapest tea bags 2-3 years old. I believe enough place was provided for overweight persons to sit on the toilet, which is not always the case in London. The room had a tv as well, a small comfortable chair and a writing desk. I got a room full of mirrors, so as long as the lights were on, I had to get to know myself better. The room was first floor and no view. I could hear some sounds from the hall, when the neighbor arrived, but soon everything was quiet. Still, I recommend ear plugs as usual. When I checked out, I didn't realize I left something very important in the room (it fell on the floor). Super important. I would be in big trouble loosing it. I asked about it when picking up my luggage and already gave up hope ever to see it again. The maid was called in by a friendly and helpful personnel and she has already packed my belonging to a neat bag and handed it to me. A complete miracle, if you ask me. I just hope the rates of this hotel don't go up too much from us reviewing it, as I would really really like to keep it as my business stay in London. Free wireless is provided to make preparations for business meetings easier. Or to stay in touch with your friends and family. The hotel has excellent location close to the palace, obviously, but also close (walking distance) to Victoria station, thus very convenient if you fly in to Gatwick and then you take the express train. You will find quite interesting shops nearby, not only the ones with some palace inspired tourism. Service in this hotel deserves A plus or - 6 our of 5 (not possible on this site).","en"
"627",3,"We stayed at the St Ermin's hotel for the weekend. The hotel is walking distance from the London Victoria station, where our train from Gatwick airport arrived. The check-in was efficient and friendly, and we were given a nice room. The hotel is in a safe and quiet area. Our rate did not include breakfast, so no comments on that. There were loads of TV channels. and there was a very nice selection of teas and coffee in the room. The hotel toiletries were good ones. Positive: The exciting history of spies (have you seen Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy?), and the fact that the hotel keeps bees and makes their own honey. The lobby which looks like a huge wedding cake. Negative: No free wifi connection. Slow lifts (just take the stairs in the morning). The price is quite high by international standards, but in London, I think this place was good value for money. Would definitely consider returning to this hotel next time I visit.","en"

"629",4,"We booked in on a Friday night fro two nights. Room was clean and the heating/air conditioning is easy to use and means you can have your room exactly at the temperature you like it. The windows open so you can have 'real' air - I'm not sure fresh is the right word for London air LOL Bathroom was one of the cleanest I've experienced in a hotel. Unfortunately the mattress was VERY uncomfortable which was a disappointment given the advertising and the hotel printed brochure which describes their wonderfully comfortable beds. I kept being poked by springs and ended up sleeping on the sofa instead - which isn't as bad as it sounds as it is meant to be an extra bed I think - the mattress on that was more comfy anyway. Breakfast will be fine as long as you like the standard offerings and don't mind boiled mushrooms. It is entirely self service. If you want porridge, or vegetarian sausages (which are delicious by the way) or eggs cooked in any way other than scrambled, you will need to find a member of staff and ask them and then good luck as to what order or when things will arrive. So don't expect to get everything hot and all in one go. Think of it as a buffet and then you won't be disappointed. We had some food from the restaurant in the evening and took it back to our room - can recommend the Tempura Prawns and the Duck Parcels. Staff were very friendly and helpful.","en"
"630",3,"This hotel used to be cheap but nice - over the years it seems to have deteriorated and become more run down. This is especially visible in the rooms - our room had clearly seen better times. It was also rather noisy, with the traffic at Russell Square providing a constant background noise. Somebody should invest in the hotel - if not they will lose out against Premier Inns and IBIS and other budget chains, that have more quality to offer.","en"
"631",3,"This hotel is well priced for the quality and location £90 on a sat night. Quick check in, room was clean enough even if a bit outdated, plenty of lifts for such a large hotel which meant no hanging around. Had a breakfast in the bar which wasn't so good, appeared to be the left overs from the morning buffet, but hey if I hadn't had a lie in I'd have been at breakfast on time!! Overall a good experience and a hotel I'd stay at again and recommend.","en"
"632",4,"Friendly reception staff who were very helpful with directions to various places. Our room was very suitable for the two of us.

Breakfast included and of a good standard.","en"
"633",4,"After first coming across the Premier Inn London County Hall on a day trip to the Capital, it seemed a good choice for a longer stay. The taxi from Euston Station couldn't drop us off right outside the hotel due to parking restrictions but the drop off was literally feet away and it wasn't too much of a problem to reach the entrance to the hotel. I thought the hotel was really good, the lobby was quite large with various drink and snack vending machines, as well as essentials such as toothbrush, toothpaste etc that you might have forgotten. The lifts were pretty fast, and after a certain time you needed a hotel key card to access them so the rest of the hotel seemed pretty secure. Our room was huge, and I mean huge, with two comfortable double beds, desk, chair, wall mounted tv and luggage storage area. The bathroom was adequately equipped with a bath and a shower, with shower gel and shampoo in a dispenser on the wall. Wi-fi was free for 30 minutes and you had the option of purchasing more if you needed/wanted it. You can store your luggage for free in the hotel, just ask at reception, which is useful if checking out and not leaving the hotel immediately. We didn't use the bar or restaurant on site, instead using the Slug & Lettuce pub opposite the hotel for breakfast and various Subway/McDonalds fast food outlets in the surrounding area for lunch etc. The best part about this hotel for me was the location, you are right behind the London Eye and other attractions such as the London Dungeon and Sea Life Aquarium. Waterloo station is a less than five minute walk away with transport links and underground station. A taxi rank is right next to the hotel if you prefer overground travel, and a bus stop for the open-top bus tours of London is right on the main road. Overall I felt that this hotel gives good value for money in London and I would definitely book again in the future.","en"

"635",5,"Hyatt Regency properties are not supposed to be this luxurious, but the Hyatt Regency London-the Churchill is just that, luxurious. The only thing I thought was not so great was the fact that the bedroom of the suite was not actually separated from the living room area. Other than that, it was a pretty amazing property. The location was quite good, close to a tube station. The service was also just wonderful. I would stay there again if other hotels I'd like to try are not available.","en"
"636",4,"Great location for a great price! We took a family room for ourselves and boys aged 10 and 7. Staff were friendly and on arrival we didn't like the first room they showed us and so they moved us into another room much more to our liking without any fuss at all. The location is perfect for a few day stay in London - we used the Big Bus tour company to get around (located just round the corner on Westminster Bridge) and also walked to a good amount of places aswell, London Eye being on the doorstep, but Buckingham Palace and Covent Garden were within reach. Eating out was great - lots of choice, we had good meals in the Italian directly opposite the hotel in eth little square by Town Hall and the boys loved the conveyor belt system at Yo Sushi just further round the corner from the Italian. We visited The London Eye, The Tower of London, took a cruise on the river, visited the Natural History Museum, the Science Museum, Hamleys Toy Store, Trafalgar Square, Buckingham Palace, Covent Garden - we need to go again to visit the rest! All in all a fantastic London visit and would not hesitate to stay at Premier Inn - Waterloo again. Breakfasts were good and filling with a good amount of choice, full English plus cereal, muffins, yoghurt, pastries etc... a good start to the day.","en"
"637",4,"I love this hotel and I almost don't want to tell anyone about it so it doesn't get more expensive and/or book up. It's a stones throw from the Earls Court tube stop, so it's convenient to get to from Heathrow and also very convenient to the rest of London. It's on a quiet street overlooking a key garden, so you feel like you live there, not just passing through. Lift is slow and small, but stairs are also available. Single room doesn't feel cramped. Furnishings are older, but in fairly good condition. Linens are clean, but pillows could do with some fluffing. Good water pressure in shower. Good channel selection on TV. Older building, so it creaks at night, but I only noticed it when I stayed in the room with the bed near the door. Have stayed 2 years in a row and would come back in a heartbeat!","en"
"638",3,"I stayed here in August of 2004 for two nights on my arrival to London, and one night on my return two weeks later. This is a 2 star hotel, so don't expect anything other than that. Decent location near the Earls Ct. and Glouchester Rd. tube stops with plenty of restaurants and shops nearby. I had a room on the 4th floor (no elevator) that was clean and spacious. The carpet appeared to be new and the bathroom was modern and well-kept. A negative with the room was that the walls had some questionable marks or smears on them. The second room on my return trip wasn't as nice as the first room. It was a little dingier and smaller and the bathroom was older and not as clean. I think the hotel has gone through some renovations, and the second room hadn't been renovated yet. When checking in or making reservations, ask for a room that has been renovated with new carpeting. Not sure the significance, but the first room that I stayed in that was renovated was on the 4th floor. The second room I stayed in that wasn't renovated was on the 1st floor. Might be a safer bet asking for a room upstairs if you can make it up there without an elevator. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The woman at the front desk was Polish and noticed that my traveling companion had a Polish name. She gave us the 'Polish' discount - 30 pounds a night! Unreal price in a very expensive city. Call to reserve a room instead of booking online, you can get a cheaper rate. They also stored our luggage in a storage closet for an entire day after we checked out so we wouldn't have to lug it around the city with us. All in all, a good hotel for the price. Don't expect anything more than a 2 star hotel though. If you're looking for a cheap place where you can lay your head down at night, this is the place. If you're looking for a place to spend a lot of time and feel like you're staying at a hotel in the States, get a room at the Best Western or Holiday Inn down the road.","en"
"639",3,"WE were a party of 10 staying in this hotel and eating in Brasserie on the Saturday evening. Beware the hidden and 'voluntary' 12.5% service charge which will appear on your bill. A whopping £55 had been added to ours. We were concerned that this money would never reach the waiting staff so deducted it. The intention was to leave the tip on the table or find the excellent waitress who had taken the order etc. The person who collected our cash came back to point out that we had not paId the correct amount. I challenged her and after some tooing and froing on her part she 'let it through'. Good of her! There is no mention of this charge on the menu. When I asked her if the menu stated we had to pay this charge she said 'not exactly' Because we were 10 individuals I guess we read the bill. How many people just pay up? If you pay by card where does that 12.5% end up??","en"

"641",5,"Having had the good fortune over many years of experiencing the hospitality of some of the premier hotels on a number of continents, I was not expecting to be ""blown away"" by the quality of The Chesterfield Mayfair. I anticipated I would be staying at a first-class Mayfair hotel. Nothing more, nothing less. There are quite a few of those, and I know some of them quite well. I could not have been more mistaken. The Chesterfield Mayfair struck me as unique from the moment I walked in the door. What I had found was a boutique jewel box of a hotel. I was greeted so warmly and effusively at the front desk by Madeline and her colleagues that it seemed they had been eagerly waiting all day for just my arrival. During the course of the next three days, I realized that the entire staff of the hotel was the epitome of professionalism, graciousness and quiet competence. This extends from the efficient doorman, through to the concierge and the excellent wait staff in the the bar and in Butler's, the superb restaurant on the premises. (Try the Sunday roast if you are there on the weekend. It is the quintessence of tradition and quality, served by the highly competent Antonio and his colleagues.) It is obvious that the management of The Chesterfield Mayfair expects nothing but the best from the staff, and the personnel deliver what is expected of them and what they have been so well trained to do. The bedroom/suite itself, like the rest of the hotel, was immaculate. It truly was a home away from home. And Mayfair, of course, is a most delightful part of London, one of the truly great cities of the world. The Chesterfield Mayfair is a gem. I can't wait to return. I know I shall, like all guests, be welcomed as an old and valued friend. Robert M. Toronto","en"

From the moment we arrived we were made to feel like we were the only guests there, welcomed with prosecco which was delicious and given an upgrade on arrival! The room was the best we have stayed in anywhere, with a four poster bed, free wine and chocolates in the room, bathroom with a rain shower and even an electric display to let them know when you want your room clean. Everything worked great in the room, including the star lights in the bed, and despite being on Shaftesbury Avenue, the noise was lower than expected. The location was fabulous also, close to many restaurants, the theatres and only about 10-15 minute walk to the Mall. Breakfast was a highlight, with all the continental you could want (including little tubs of Nutella and real glass milk cartons) and the cooked breakfast was great too. We had a massage in the spa and used their free sauna, steam room and whirlpool. All of the facilities were really good and the massages even better, I would definitely recommend getting one whilst there!

The guest services team was fantastic and accommodating of my son's need to get supplies to write down all of his memories of London - he asked them several times over the course of our week stay.

After eating 2 dinners and 1 breakfast, I woke with a terrible case of nausea. We left for a train the last morning to board a cruise ship in Southampton. I was sick and unable to eat for 3 days.

We stayed in a Deluxe family room which was large and contained a full-sized sofa bed. Free use of the spa is a great addition to the room price, which isn't very expensive for what you are getting. The pool however is very small but the spa makes up for it with design and very friendly staff. The only downside is you are pretty far away from the tube (how most people get around London) with Sloane Square being the closest one at around a 20 min walk, Buses do stop opposite the hotel, which will take you straight to Oxford Circus. I would stay here again but would be so much more prepared with transport into the city!","en"
"660",5,"Although 4-5 miles away from Big Ben etc, the trip across London on the tube was part of the experience, as was the alternative travel experience of the ferry back to Westminster the next day. Although this extra travelling added to the cost, it was all fun; the river ferry had beautiful views and took us past various landmarks. The hotel and room had stunning sparkling city views of Canary Wharf across the river at night, and the family room had a small balcony so we could enjoy the view further. The room was clean and ample size. An extra bed had been provided for our third child. Breakfast was a self serve of full English, meat platter, cereals, fruit, yoghurt, cakes etc. and was very nice. Staff incredibly helpful. Restaurant menu for other meals reasonably priced, but beware service charge and cost of drinks, that soon doubled the price! Parents and children (7, 9, 11) all really enjoyed the stay, although we might try and stay a bit closer to the centre next time, as we had to pull suitcase in tow due to distances (but this wasn't a big problem)","en"
"661",3,"I certainly recommend this hotel to anyone on a budget needing to stay near Paddington Station. I stayed at the Castleton for one night in January 2014 and it perfectly suited my needs. I had a late flight into Heathrow and was taking a train from Paddington the following day, so the location of the Castleton made it ideal for my needs. It is a solid low-to-mid range hotel. The pros and cons, in my humble opinion, are as follows: Pros: 1. Location. As I said it was perfect for my need to get to Paddington in the morning. Being approximately only one block away from Paddington it is very convenient to both western rail and London’s tube system. The neighborhood has plenty of pubs, restaurants and other services any traveler might need. 2. Cleanliness. For such a small and inexpensive place I found this hotel immaculate. This was true for my room as well as the common areas. 3. Staff. All members of staff I encountered, from the front desk, to the restaurant staff at breakfast, to housekeeping were friendly and helpful. When I needed a slightly late checkout, my request was immediately and graciously granted. 4. Wifi. The wireless in my room worked extremely well with no interruptions. 5. The room. While small, the bed was comfortable and it had tea and coffee making facilities. 6. Free breakfast. While certainly not the best I’ve ever had, it was certainly not bad by any means – and it was included in the price of the room. 7. The price. While I know the prices fluctuate dramatically during the year, it was mid-winter when I stayed there and I further qualified for a special £5 off special the hotel was running. As such, a rate of £39/night could not be beat. Cons: 1. The room. I know I put this as a pro, and it was for the reasons I noted, but the room was incredibly small. In fairness, I did only book a single en suite, so can’t comment on other rooms, but the bathroom in particular was barely big enough to shower in. As I only stayed at the hotel for one night, this was no problem, but I could see it being a bit difficult for longer stays. 2. Hallway size. This is a rather small hotel after all, but a small hallway combined with a rather old elevator means that whenever anyone came to my floor in the middle of the night, I could hear it. Lighter sleepers might have issues being woken up throughout the night. Overall, I enjoyed the Castleton, particularly as I only needed to stay there one night. I would certainly recommend it to anyone needing, or wanting, to stay near Paddington Station","en"
"662",4,"My room was spacious and well-appointed, the bed was very comfortable and I really appreciated the double window with blackout blind. The location is excellent - right next to several restaurants, Tate Modern, the Globe Theatre, and just across Millennium Bridge from the City. The full English breakfast has a good, though basic, range. At £16.50 I suppose its what you pay in London. There's a couple of quirks that bear mentioning for future travellers: 1. On Google Maps, you're going to Mercure Bankside. The listing for Mercure London Bridge is off by a block. 2. There are steps into the lobby from both entrances. 3. I was offered (via email) the chance to upgrade for £4 per night. I clicked to accept, but on arrival was not told that I had been upgraded. I think(?) I was in the larger size room, but did not receive the soft drinks, toiletries and bathrobe that was promised. At checkout, I was invoiced for the upgrade, but I explained the situation and the charge was waived. So if you click to upgrade, double check at check-in what the outcome is. I would certainly stay again. I got around by public transport very easily, and the room was cool, comfortable and quiet.","en"
"663",3,"Too many mixed feelings about this hotel, so listed pros and cons below: Pros: Location - 2 mins walk from Oxford St shopping, 5 mins talk to 2 different tube stations. 3 mins walk to Charlotte St restaurants Theme: Stunning lobby and lobby bars. Stunning pool room. Furniture is beautiful and beyond modern. Rooms: Very beautiful and modern. Nicely decorated and provide an oasis to the city. Cons: There's a real snobbish feel about the staff. I was questioned in the lift (with my room key in my hand) if I was a guest of the hotel. Yes, I paid the exorbitant price to stay here. Yes, I had a room key, and yes, I also looked haggered and jet-lagged, but don't question people. The lobby bar is a real destination for nearby workers to come have a drink after work, so it was very busy and noisy after 5pm Way too overpriced for what it is - a funky hotel. No extra added services. No brekkie included or anything. Elevator is disgusting. Its almost pitch black in there with solar-system-like walls and lights. It made me feel sick every time I entered it. Also, hallways to rooms are very dark.","en"
"664",3,"This hotel was previously part of the Jury's Inn chain and we have stayed here several times in the past but not since it changed hands. We were therefore curious to see if any improvements or changes had been made. The short answer is yes. The hotel has had a thorough refurbish and makeover and certainly looks and feels more modern but has possibly lost some of it's character. Check in was efficient and our room was ready on arrival at 12:30 pm. However, nobody told us about the lift around the corner from reception which would have been far handier for our particular room than the one we used nor did they they inform us of the breakfast times. Our deluxe room was fine and well up to four star standard. It was supposedly an upgrade but it was hard to see how it differed from a Classic room - no water, dressing gowns, biscuits etc. We had lunch with our daughter in the newly designed and refitted bar but we didn't repeat the experience during our three night stay. The food was poor and the girl behind the bar seemed incapable of operating the till without constantly calling for assistance. Breakfast was very good and an improvement on the Jury's Inn. The restaurant has been extended so there is now more seating and less queuing. There is a wide range of good quality food but also a wide range of serving staff efficiency. The porridge comes highly recommended. One noticeable feature of the hotel was the fact that most of the staff we encountered around the corridors totally ignored us. I usually find that in a well run establishment the staff are trained to acknowledge the guests' presence. The hotel is well placed for easy access from Euston, Kings Cross, St Pancras and Angel and a number 73 Victoria bus directly opposite will take you to the West End. There are plenty of shops,bars and restaurants in nearby Angel and the York pub is worth a visit. Chapel Market is just around the corner too and has quite a buzz about it. We will certainly return to the Double Tree in future because of its location and price but would hope that the staff training and bar food had improved.","en"
"665",4,"Good place to stay, the staff was great and really atencious, the room was good and the location is ok. It's really worth the price and i had a good time in there during my first days in London exploring the city.","en"
"666",4,"We sadky only stayed one night in this hotel. We arrived quite late after going to the theatre but had a very warm welcome. We had a room upgrade and found the room to be very spacious. The wetroom was large and very well equipped. We had a very comfortable night on a very comfortable bed. The bed linen was of excellent quality and very stylush. Our room was at the front of the hotel and was surprisingly quiet.","en"
"667",5,"We had to move here in a hurry late in the evening when we had problem with the plumbing in another hotel. We were able to agree a small reduction in the room rate as it was so late. We were personally greeted on arrival and the staff were very sympathetic to the problems we had experienced. The room was large and the bed was very comfortable. It was very quiet all night even though it was a Saturday. The hotel has a very luxurious feel but my only issue would be that it does not feel like you are in London - you could be in any luxury city hotel. Having said that the level of service is also similar to that in luxury hotels worldwide - all the staff were very friendly and helpful and this makes a big difference in that it lessens the corporate feel of the style of the hotel. The breakfast in the mirror room was excellent and beautifully displayed - even juice in a silver cup rather than a glass!! It was also nice to have a small farmers' market in the courtyard on the Sunday morning. Altogether a lovely experience.","en"
"668",2,"Perhaps the worst value hotel I have ever stayed in. When I booked, the website told me that I was apparently getting a £250pn hotel for £99. To be honest, I felt £99 was three times the price that this hotel deserved. The smallest rooms I have stayed in for a long time. Small television set and seems to be volume limited such that it is impossible to hear. Apparently recently rennovated - to be honest, it needs doing again. The whole place had a very battered look, as if someone had been going around hitting it with a stick. The rooms were small - even a double room - you basically had to walk around the place sideways to get anywhere. Shower acceptable, but small again. Free wi-fi internet, great if you have a laptop and just want to run a Web Browser (user name and password required). Trying to connect my Android phone to it was an abject failure. The lift - slow and noisy. To be honest I could actually walk up the stairs in about the same amount of time as it took the lift to go up. To give some positives: Reasonable continental breakfast, helpful staff, convenient location for the London Underground and Euston Station. But, on the whole, don't go here - I will never be returning.","en"

"670",5,"After the airlines lost my luggage and my cell phone would not work, I was happy to find that Arosfa was everything as described in its website and in the TripAdvisor reviews. My room was clean and cosy, the breakfast buffet was yummy and healthy, and my hosts, Tessa and Attila were incredibly nice and helpful. Arosfa is centrally located by tube, bus, or train. If you are a walker, it is in walking distance of many sites. I stayed for six nights and I will return again when back in London.","en"
"671",5,"This is the 2nd or 3rd time I have stayed at this hotel. It has the normal Holiday Inn Express with good levels of cleanliness. The reception staff were particularly friendly and helpful. Breakfast was the normal choice of hot & cold self-service but quite a small selection of cold items. Hot is the normal mass produced & cooked scrambled egg & bacon. However, quality I have found is slightly better than other Holiday Inn Expresses I have stayed at. The pillows are very hard – even the ‘soft’ choice, which did disturb my sleep. However, this is a generic problem with Holiday Inn Express, rather than this hotel. Apart from that the room was quiet and the window could be opened for fresh air. Spotlessly clean. I chose this hotel as it is relatively easy to travel to Euston & St Pancras with one tube change. I would allow 30 minutes to Euston & 40 minutes to St Pancras at peak times. Finchley Road tube station is 5 minutes’ walk (come out of the station, turn left cross the road using the underpass and then carry on in the same direction for about 300 metres. For Euston, to avoid the walk from Euston Square – change at Green Park on the Jubilee line. The Victoria line will then take you straight to Euston or St Pancras – much easier than travelling from Euston Square which involves a lot of walking, not only from Euston but at the change at Baker Street (very long walk between platforms). I would stay at this hotel again and the overall experience was very good. It is considerably cheaper than similar hotels in the vicinity of Euston, so worth the tube journey in my opinion.","en"
"672",1,"No help with bags on arrival, luckily only a (big) carry on so walked into the hotel. Was met by someone in a suit who asked 'can i help you sir' i said yes please you can take this. He was not amused as he was a security guard rather than a staff member (who were conspicuous by their absence) apparently can i help you is code for what the h*** are you doing in my hotel. I was in jeans and a jacket as i dont fly in a suit and tie and i knew the dress code but assumed i would least be allowed to check in without being hassled then change. Apparently not we then debated whether i should go to the toilets and change before checking or whether i should change in the street in although he eventually relented. Oddly a number of regular or more famous guests apparently can wear what they want. Notwithstanding the above found it rather underwhelming, old worn faded carpets, slight smell of must, run down old furniture in rooms. More security guards than a russian hotel, with about as much training. Also full of people trying to be something they are not which is quite apt because the hotel is doing the same. also problem with internet and room key. Prefer to go to another 5 star like an intercontinental or Radisson where you will get a better room and better service probably at a better price","en"
"673",5,"Stayed here after my friends wedding in London. A lovely hotel, great staff, great food (room service menu). Staff were very accommodating. Would recommend to anyone who wants to stay in London. A great location too, lots of things within walking distance.","en"
"674",5,"There are many reasons why my husband and I consider this an excellent hotel: 1)The hotel management is phenomenal We were impressed with how accommodating and attentive the staff were with us. Our flight arrived at 8:00 am, so we were resigned to take a taxi from Heathrow and request the hotel to let us leave our luggage there so we could walk to attractions until check-in time. The manager quickly realized that we looked tired, and made sure our room was ready for us. Our room was ready within 20 minutes of arrival. During those 20 minutes we were taken care of with warm towels, water, tea...you name it. We requested something, and management took care of it immediately. We were able to take a nap that gave us enough energy to walk through the city and enjoy our first day! 2) Convenient location in one of the safest areas in London Take a left, walk for 2-5 minutes and you will find Buckingham Palace. There is also a stop right outside Buckingham's gift shop to take different double deckers to tour the city. Take a right and you are on your way to many more attractions. We were able to walk to Westminster Abbey, the Cathedral, Parliament, Thames, Big Ben, etc. 3)Rooms are spacious and well equipped See pictures. I didn't care about the view (garden) because we woke up early and came to the room to sleep. I can't comment on that. The room had a washer and dryer, but I can't comment on that because we didn't use it. 4)Access to convenience stores, drugstores, Pret a Manger, restaurants, etc. The only minus: small elevator which we only took upon arrival and upon departure because we had luggage. We use the stairs everywhere we go. I highly recommend this hotel!","en"
"675",5,"What a wonderful experience staying in the Zetter was........ From the moment I arrived the reception I felt special and very modern. The rooms are just fab, I just love the pink lights, choice of music and all the quirky extras that are dotted around the rooms, very original. I also really appreciated the local information that was in the room for the guests, not only interesting but very useful The convenience of the vending machines on each floor is a brilliant idea, how many times have I forgotten that vital essential, and there they all were, not to mention the naughty treats, vodka redbull and chocolate yum yum! I had breakfast and dinner in the hotel, again, service and food was just wonderful. The menu had that ""special something"" which made the meals just irresistible. Would I come and stay again.........absolutely would recommend to everyone!","en"
"676",2,"My husband and I recently stayed at the hotel for one night 5th Nov whilst attending a show at the O2 arena. Room cost was £51.00 (plus vat) for a standard room for 2 people for the night. The initial check in experience was poor; the receptionist was quick enough to take a £50 room deposit (despite the cost already being pre-paid before arrival) but failed to give information about the hotel facilities e.g. for access to the swimming pool – you need pool towel cards from reception (and failure to return them will incur a charge upon departure) and a £1 coin for the lockers is needed. I was given key cards for room 2004, but when I got to the room neither card worked. The roof in the ceiling in the corridor outside room 2004 was missing and building work is going on – so not exactly a best impression. The room also turned out to be a twin room, which I did not want. So had to return back to reception only to be told that no change could be given as I had booked a room for 2 people and the room fulfilled this obligation and no other rooms were available unless I wanted to pay an upgrade. The receptionist eventually agreed to a change to a double room with a walk-in –shower (room3047) – so beware when you are booking a standard room and the conditions applied. I used the pool facilities which were good and clean with large changing rooms and showers with hairdryers the big draw back is the pool is accessed from the changing area by 2 flights of steep stairs (in wet feet) so not ideal and I thought quite dangerous to navigate. I also had to wait at the pool reception desk for 20 mins to get my room card and towel card back (as it was unmanned,) I ended up having to go to staff at the main hotel reception desk who then came to the pool desk only to find the drawer locked so I had to then return to the hotel reception desk to get a new set of room keys. This was all really frustrating. Room 3047 then turned out to have no cold water in the taps. The mixer tap only had hot or scolding hot options (steam was coming off the taps), which we reported to the hotel desk. Only to be told that it was a common problem and to let the taps run for 15 mins. We said this was not good on two fronts one to have to wait for 15 mins each time we used the facilities and secondly it was not very ‘green’ for the hotel policy to knowingly leave a tap running and wasting water each time. On arrival back at the hotel (midnight) the taps were still the same with no note or message left in the room. So we went back to the reception desk at midnight, and advised that they sent someone up to the room after having left them running for the time they had ran cool. The night manager then came up to the room and again we found the only option was scolding hot water and we were again advised to let the taps run for the required time. When we advised we did not think this was an appropriate outcome and that this meant each trip to the bathroom would take 15 mins they agreed to bring up some bottled water for us to use in the interim. When we checked out of the hotel we asked to speak to the manager about the situation who advised that all rooms with ‘47’ in them had problems and when we asked for some compensation for the lack of usable facilities and frustration caused we were offered either a free breakfast (at 11.30 am?) or a refund of 20% of the £51 room cost, which we accepted as a gesture of goodwill. Staff were however very polite at all times and the overall standard of the room (apart from the taps and towels which were a bit raggedy) and décor within the hotel was very good, clean and modern – all of which had attracted me to the hotel in the first place. The hotel is a good base for the O2 (as long as the Jubilee and DLR lines are working) as otherwise I think you would struggle to get to the hotel. For the price that we paid £51 (plus VAT) it was okay – but would not like to have paid more for the same overall experience.","en"
"677",4,"If you enjoy staying at small and personal hotels, I recommend The Sumner close to Marble Arch. Excellent value for money, very welcoming staff and an easy place to feel at home in. Breakfast was tasty and plentiful, service at the hotel was over all attentive and very friendly. The room was smallish, but adequate. We asked for a quiet room and it sure was. Did not hear a sound from outside or inside, exceptionally peaceful. And with the comfy beds, you slept like a child. The room was very clean and comfortable, but we missed the tea- & coffee facilities. You could order your tea from the room service, though. One particular thing that struck me as unusual, was that the ventilation/aircon of the room was working very well. That is something that often bothers me when staying at hotels, it´s difficult to get that right temperature and amount of air. At The Sumner that worked wonderful and changed very quickly to the chosen climate. For me, thats noteworthy... Th Sumner is suitable for both pleasure and business trips and we would be happy to stay there again.","en"

We had a suite which consisted of three floors and the decor was gorgeous. I have to be honest and say I really could not fault anything. Everything done at this hotel is generous and anything you ask for seems to be done immediately, without any issues and with a smile.

"689",3,"I spend a lot of time on my computer, and the desk and chair at the Mandarin Oriental are not quite fit for this. Fantastic for transfer to/from Heathrow; the Knightsbridge Tube station is beside the hotel; just £5.70 and one hour on the Piccadilly line. Both room and bathroom are spacious. There are two armchairs in addition to the desk and chair. There is enough space for a room-service trolley and two people to eat at the same time (except, of course, that there is only one desk/dining chair). And enough space to open a sutibase without it getting in the way. WiFi is very, very fast. Shampoo, soap and body lotion were notably good; mouthwash not provided. Air conditioning is effective and responsive without creating an uncomfortable draft. Duvet is very comfortable. I like an iron and shoe cream/polish in the room; but at the Mandarin Oriental you are required to send out for pressing and polishing. Laundering a shirt, socks and underwear costs £31 a day. One shirt was returned with a plastic bead melted into the fabric, and a safety pin through the bead. Puzzled. Wonton noodle and nasi goreng from room service were adequate. Likewise the English breakfast; would have liked tomatoes without pesto, streaky in place of back bacon, and fried bread.","en"
"690",3,"This is a business hotel in a location I would not have chosen, but my husband was attending a conference in the hotel. The Danubius is part of a Hungarian chain and the staff at the front desk is typically eastern European, brisk but lacking warmth. Our room was on a non-smoking floor, which curiously smelled like cigarette smoke in the corridor. Our room was pretty quiet and a good size with a decent bed, but what was supposed to be the 'comfortable' chair was stiff and outdated, and it was so stained we wouldn't sit in it. The bathroom was average. We had a drink in the bar one night and our waitress had never head of Tio Pepe sherry, though it was on the menu. It arrived warm in a whisky glass. Don't expect any nibbles. The buffet breakfast was very good, and the breakfast staff first rate, friendly and efficient. Though they were extremely busy every morning, coffee and tea were always brought to our table right away. The hotel is right next to Regents Park and the Central Mosque. The nearest tube stops are Baker Street or St. John's Wood, and both are about a 1/2 mile walk. Bus stops to Oxford Street and Piccadilly are close by, however, and you're walking distance to the delightful Marylebone High Street and the Sherlock Holmes Museum. Around the corner from the hotel are two excellent espresso bars.","en"
"691",3,"The room was adequately sized for a family of 4 but very plain.

We had one (justfied) complaint after one of our kids fell out of a chair. My gripe is that I specifically contacted the hotel through e-mail to make sure the place was very kid friendly. They said it was, but after my stay I disagree. Service was restauraunt - excellent concierge - good front desk - marginal For the price, we were disappointed and will look elsewhere.","en"

The DLR made getting around the city so easy, so we enjoyed some lovely meals and managed to see Wicked. The one thing I would say about the hotel is that I was suprised that we were asked to pay £2.50 for the use of the swimming pool, that seemed like such a small sum but in principle after forking out for the stay it seemed a little ridiculous to charge us to use the pool. That didnt ruin our stay though. I would definately recommend this hotel for those who fancy a nice break in the city.","en"

I'm having trouble writing how excellent every single second of our stay was. All i have left to say is a great big Thank You! You made Sarah (my fiance :-) feel the luckiest girl in the world!","en"
"698",1,"The location was advertised as a particular street just round the corner from Camden lock. In fact, the apartment was a 30 minute walk from the location advertised. A massive con, which I have seen from other reviews is a complaint of many others. Will never use them again, and would positively discourage anyone from using this very dishonest organisation.","en"
"699",4,"Stayed here with my mum for 2 nights in January with a great deal from Superbreak which included the hotel and tickets for the opening night of Oliver. The hotel is in a great location, across the road from Green Park and a few minutes walk from the tube station and about 10 minutes walk from Piccadilly Circus. The staff are friendly from the moment you arrive and very helpful. The room was great with 2 large single beds which were so comfortable and had big squashy pillows. We had a big bathroom (with a window) and lovely toiletries. The breakfast was fine, the continental probably better than the cooked breakfast. Would love to stay here again. Best London hotel bed I've slept in.","en"

"701",2,"Stayed here for four days for work. Was the bosses choice. Staff were very friendly and nice on arrival, price is usual Travleodge fare. Unfortunately room genuinely stunk, reeked of dampness and possibly sweat? Carpets, bedstead(although not sheets, thankfully) all dirty. Table all chipped. 100% would not recommend and only gave two stars due to the very nice staff (since it's not necessarily their fault it's a s**thole)","en"
"702",5,"I've never done a review on here before as I can't say I've ever stayed in a hotel worthy of my time and typing. However I stayed with the Zetter for my birthday this year and had an absolutely wonderful time. It may cost slightly more than your standard chain hotel, but that it because it IS so much more than a standard chain. It's welcoming, quirky, fun and extremely good value for money. I will never stay in a cheap hotel ever again. For about an extra £30 from a 3 star hotel in the centre you get such wonderful service and high quality rooms. The room are not massive but for me and my friend who were sharing and spending the afternoon pampering ourselves there was plenty of room. The bathroom was much more spacious than any other hotel I've stayed in (for the size of the room) and the hotel had thought of everything. I can't think of one thing I wasn't happy with. Would recommend to anyone and will most definitely be staying again next time I'm in London. Utterly fantastic.","en"
"703",4,"Had a lovely stay here - staff fantastic and lovely decor. My room had a great view of Hyde park and the a/c was perfect. Close to lots of areas to walk around and great places to eat. Only downside was breakfast was the usual buffet affair and nothing special.","en"

"706",4,"What a pleasant surprise we had ! You'd be wrong to expect just another cookie-cutter, part-of-a-chain hotel experience here. The staff are lovely ! The place itself is standard issue HI so you know it'll be reasonable but we found everything to our liking. The location is excellent. You exit Swiss Cottage tube, turn left, walk 300-400 Meters, cross at the traffic lights and you're at the front door. Rest assured, you will see the hotel on the other side of the road within 60 seconds of leaving the tube station.","en"
"707",5,"This is our 2nd time staying at this hotel, we've returned because the location is just fantastic. We returned to London with our in-laws to take in the sites of London, the area of 7 dials is packed with stuff to do, places to eat and drink. We didn't fancy doing a show this year but instead booked a last minute 'comedy show' which was just off one of the 7 Dials roundabout and it was fantastic and then just a short walk home. Our trip to London will continue annually and this is the place for us to stay.","en"
"708",1,"This hotel is a pure joke, last week i arrived in London on a trip with my College class, we arrived at the Royal National Hotel, we tried to keep optimistic about the hotel as the look of it was similar to an army barracks, i suppose we couldn't judge a book by its cover so when we entered we kept up high hopes that the hotel would be nice and welcoming. As we entered we were greeted by very blunt and dull staff, they were ignorant, unwilling to answer our questions and I felt like they were trying to rush us as fast as they could. Instead of smiles we were greeted with displeasure and ignorance, I couldn't understand a word what they were saying and their overall attitude was just negative. this wasn't a good start but still, we remained optimistic. As we ascended to our rooms the hallways were tatty and old, the wallpaper was tacky and stained. The carpets were also disgusting and dusty, the colour of the carpet was awful also, I am not usually a picky person but when i entered this hotel i could only notice the flaws, and there were many. The overall feel of the hotel was uncomfortable and off-putting, i just wanted to leave straight away. Trying to keep optimistic I entered the rooms, the rooms were quite nice compared to the rest of the hotel, the beds looked nice and the overall room was quite comforting, although this feeling didn't last long as i lay down on the 'bed' which felt more like a plank. The bed was so stiff and uncomfy, the sheets were paper thin. I could feel each individual spring dig into my back, not to mention the fact the rooms were freezing and cold. due to this i had lost lots of hours sleep that night. Other than the ignorance of the staff, the breakfast was one of the worst things about the hotel, the so called 'food' that was provided was tasteless, boring and an overall lack of choice. I have never entered a hotel in which i have to pay an extra £5 for a cooked meal, absolutely appalling. The whole 'Wi-Fi' appeal of the hotel is bad too, a total con. I really recommend that if you are on a trip to London and are looking for a hotel, save yourself the time and money by searching for another hotel, this Hotel is a total sham and a joke, and should not have anyone spending their money on such a bad hotel. I hope this has been beneficial towards you.","en"

The room was very clean and elegant (the whole hotel is very nicely decorated), and there was a pantry at the end of the corridor providing free coffee and cake, apples and sweets (really nice additional feature, particularly if you have kids). The rooms are very quiet. I tried the restaurant during a different journey, food was nice.","en"

Unfortunately next to a huge construction site but still very quiet.","en"

"713",4,"This hotel has high technology in the room and it took awhile to find out how all was functioning. However, good teaching by the personel. My single room wqas very small but for a one night business trip it functioned perfectly. English breakfast was perfect though with a little extra fee, but it was worth it. The surrounding is nice with a park in front of the hotel. Service good and very clean hotel. Recommended for short stays.","en"
"714",4,"Came here for the night so that we (my wife and I) could go to a restaurant without having to go back home for the night. Room was very a reasonable price for a four star hotel in London. My only disappointment was that after checking in online, we arrived about 12 and the room wasn't ready (they do say that the room is not guaranteed until 2 pm, although it says it MAY be ready earlier if you check in online). We then went and had a very nice lunch in the bar and went back to reception at 1.30-still not ready so back to the bar. 2 pm room still not ready so we were told to wait in the bar and they would bring our keycard through when ready. Just before 2.15 a girl arrived with the key. The room was nice and comfortable with tea and coffee making facilities. The bed was a bit uncomfortable but most hotel beds outside the US seem to be! I would recommend this hotel, the location is excellent with the Tower just round the corner and you can get a boat down the river to many London must sees or take a walk along the Embankment. It is literally yards from Fenchurch Street main line station and Tower Hill underground Station. Nice surprise when we arrived back to the bar, a bit of music with a singer guitarist and other music during his breaks. We will almost certainly use this hotel again.","en"
"715",1,"The booking company insisted I paid for our two nights, before I saw this hotel or I would have cancelled and gone upmarket to a Premier Inn, Best Western or even Tune. My two accolades are that this is the worst 'hotel' I have ever had the misfortune to stay at in London (and I have stayed at a number) and it is the most overpriced. The room we stayed in was like a windowless basement room. There was one 'window' of thick frosted glass which was covered by a blind. The floor was composed of bare wooden boards, no carpet, no furniture so could not unpack case, all there was, were some hooks on the wall. The bathroom was a narrow alleyway-type of room tacked onto the side of the bedroom with shower, toilet and sink. It was very depressing and was so bad that I did not have the energy to complain about the non existent reception on the in-room TV until I left gladly on the second day. It was all very Spartan but I surmise that someone is making money out of it.","en"

"718",5,"We arrived at The Rubens at 11am, not expecting our room to be ready, and were amazed that we could go to the room. This was the start of a lovely experience, mainly because all, and I mean all, the staff are so unbelievably friendly and helpful. You can have a lovely hotel but if the staff are miserable, it's just not enjoyable. Unfortunately, we could only stay one night but we made the most of it! We had lunch in the bar - very nice. We ate in The Old Library restaurant downstairs and the food is top class - very romantic and laid-back atmosphere too. Breakfast had everything you could possible want and would expect from a great hotel, eggs cooked to order, fresh fruit, etc. Also plenty of room to sit. So many London hotels don't have big enough breakfast rooms and the queues can be horrendous. Also the Rubens' breakfast dining room is lovely, chandeliers and carpeted. Our bedroom was in the Royal Suite. It was lovely with a spacious bathroom, overlooking the Royal Mews at the front of the hotel. We didn't hear a thing all night, the mattress was really comfortable (my husband has back problems too) and it couldn't be faulted. The interior of the hotel couldn't be faulted. It has been updated in keeping with the age of the building which is what you would expect. We love older, quirky hotels - it's always much more fun than stark, new or chain hotels. I would definitely recommend The Rubens at The Palace. Great hotel, great location and great service. We will be returning.","en"

They are just excellent - the people at the front desk, the concierge, the people who work in the breakfast area, and all who I've come in contact they have all been so attentive and also have very positive dispositions. It is so refreshing. The hotel is very clean, in great condition, and the breakfast is phenomenal. There is only a short walk from the nearest tube (5-7 minutes) on the Jubilee line (Swiss Cottage). I have really enjoyed staying here.","en"

We arrived early, and were told that we had been upgraded to a Royal King room with a river view, and ""Wow, what a view!"". We were looking right over the River Thames at the London Eye!!! What we expected to be a king sized bed, turned out to be 6ft wide. Beautiful decor, spotlessly clean, light and spacious. The staff were kind and courteous, and the breakfast was lovely with the waitresses making sure you always had a full cup of coffee or tea. We did not have an evening meal in the restaurant, but vegetarians are very well catered for on the menu. A stones throw from Embankment Tube station, and Charing Cross. We had a wonderful weekend, and would definately use the hotel again.","en"
"725",4,"The Sunborn is just as it appears. The hotel is excellent and modern, possibly one of the best Ive stayed in in the UK and compares to 5* in Dubai and Singapore I've stayed in. However, while it does have a 'wow factor' from the outside, once on board, it is just a hotel until you look out a porthole. The location is not brilliant unless you are at ExCel or the O2 but the DLR is only 5 min walk away so if you get a good deal, its definitely worth it. Otherwise, stick with city hotels (though you may not get the size of room). This is better than hotels I've stayed at in Canary Wharf though. Large room, nice bathroom and I got the water side room I requested. Staff were very friendly and helpful, no issues as others have mentioned. Didn't have breakfast (£20 extra) - much prefer a greasy spoon! Would return if there was a good offer on again.","en"

"727",4,"We chose this hotel based on the tripadvisor reviews. Most of what has been said is true. What I would specially highlight is the excellent (and non arrogant service). They were extremely helpful and nice, unbooked and booked restaurants for us... offered us tea upon arrival, the afternoon tea was really nice as well as the champagne with canapes... We had a superior room in the ground floor -where the rooms are supposed to be the largest. The room was indeed spacious, comfortable, clean and decorated with some beautiful (and some not so beautiful) antiques, the bathroom was quite small. All and all I would not go into superlatives about the room. We payed over 400 US $ per night... and I think that this is quite a bit of money for what you get. But I guess accomodation in London is just extremely expensive....","en"

And though we stayed for 3 nights the hotel could do nothing to fix it other than offer to move our rooms. Bathrooms are badly constructed with the shower cubicle in a corner - need to stand at an angle to take a partial shower. There is one great restaurant in the hotel - rated Top 10 for seafood in London - get there early, kitchen shuts at 10pm. The hotel needs to be renovated.","en"

"730",4,"The entrance is stunning, with lots of gleaming brass and crystal and the most welcoming reception staff. Asked 'what time did you book dinner' (It wasn't mentioned by the third party booking site), I hadn't, so was promised a call in the room to let me know if my preferred time was possible. The charming Allesandro showed us to our balcony room and explained the coffee machine and how the room card allowed us in and out. He even went to the trouble of bringing 2 jugs of hot milk so we could have cappuccinos. Our dinner time was confirmed as slightly earlier than we'd have liked, but a separate call from the Restaurant gave us our chosen time. We had bubbly on our balcony looking at a not terribly exciting view - very remote from the city, and there was no table to accompany the chairs, although after dark it's fun to watch the lit up cable cars moving across the skyline.. Dinner was excellent. Our free glass of champagne arrived promptly, the reception and waiting staff were first class. Nothing was too much trouble and they worked the restaurant expertly, discreetly and oh so smoothly. Ten Stars to them all. The scallop - just one - was the smallest I've seen, overwhelmed by far too much pea purée, but tasty and perfectly cooked. My friend had the lamb which was lovely, pink and perfect as was my pork belly meal - four large squares - very tasty, and with crispy crackling. I had the best ever sticky toffee pudding - gooey but with an outer crunch, my friend opting for the panna cotta, also excellent. I'd selected the Three Choirs Gloucestershire white which was reasonably priced and perfectly chilled and served. Throughout the dinner the staff were discreetly attentive and anticipated everything we needed, serving our meal in a timely fashion and I couldn't fault the evening. Breakfast, a buffet, was excellent and offered everything one could want. No dried up items in the chafing dishes, as the vigilant staff were constantly replenishing items - even the fried egg was still runny. My friend went off menu by asking for 2 poached eggs which were cooked promptly and to perfection. It's so important for hotel staff training to be thorough in all areas and, with a background in high end customer service I'd say they are amongst the best I've come across. Now, here's the thing. After dinner there was no 'entertainment', only the bar, and the ship is miles from anywhere so I do think a singer or pianist, or something is needed. The bed was comfortable, there was a fridge in the room, but absolutely no hotel information, even tho there is 24 hour room service, but no idea of what's on offer, not that there's much to know, and hat's off to our, again charming, checkout receptionist, who told us the hotel aims to minimise it's paper trail and would upgrade information on the room tablet shortly. I would certainly recommend this super yacht, being the four stars it lays claim to, but the staff are most definitely 10 stars!!! If you're going to the Excel centre have an overnight stay and, though we didn't, you could take advantage of the Elemis Spa and have a lovely relaxing foot massage!","en"

Only 2 tea bags and 4 coffee sachets supplied along with 4 milks, the rest of the box had herbal and fruit tea bags. Nice biscuits. No double glazing so room was very noisy even though it was in the back. Asked for room with a view no walls, received a room with partial wall views disappointing. Staff were friendly. Breakfast was really poor. Choice of cornflakes or coco pops. Yogurt, bread and jams. Horrible tasting french stick, very small pastries about 4 or 5 only in the box (they did taste very good) and some fruit in a bowl mainly apple in a very small corridor type room. The breakfast was very very basic and not worth having. Picked this hotel because I wanted breakfast so disappointed. Felt the hotel was a little too far from the main places in London. Would I go back, No.","en"
"734",5,"Our family of 5 stayed in 2 rooms for four nights during a half term break in London. The rooms were clean and functional, the staff friendly and the breakfast good value.

Etap/Ibis budget hotels provide great value for money - I just which they offered interconnecting rooms!","en"
"735",5,"We stayed here for 3 nights to celebrate our 10 year wedding anniversary. As it was a special occasion at check in we were asked if we would like to wait half an hour for a room with a better view to be ready and it was well worth the wait. We were on the 12th floor with views over London city including the London Eye just about the top of Westminster and the financial district skyscrapers. Hotel was very modern and luxurious, all fixtures and fittings of a very high standard and impeccably clean. The rain shower in the room was amazing and the bed enormous and very comfy! Breakfast was very nice with a vast range of items on offer to cater for every taste. Every member of staff we engaged with was happy, friendly and curteous. Fantastic location as it is about half way between Euston and Kings Cross St Pancras so anywhere we wanted to go was just a short tube ride away. The hotel seem very keen to hear feedback and are very willing to take care of any concerns even if they are only minor, so all in all a great all round review!","en"
"736",5,"We had a great time at this hotel. We went as a special treat and it's rather more upmarket than we're used to (most of the other people staying there looked like bankers) but the staff were lovely to us, even offering to look after our scruffy rucksacks the day after our stay. The room was a good size, quiet, comfortable and attractive. It had the best mini bar I've ever seen, with a good choice of gins! We didn't eat dinner there, but, based on the quality of the breakfast, I'd expect it to be good. We also found the location very convenient for walking round the centre of London and found plenty of nice little shops and cafes nearby. It's not cheap, but definitely a good choice for a special occasion.","en"

"738",1,"I used the conference facilities at the Marylebone hotel for 3 days in June 2010. Quite simply, nothing went right. Early on the air conditioning failed and staff struggled to provide even cold water in what rapidly became 30 degree heat in the meeting room. The hotel then provided noisy and ineffective air conditioning units which reduced the heat to about 29 degrees adding the noise of two washing machines into the conference room. By the third day, the room's video projector started to shut down every five minutes during my presentation. This, combined with the heat and noise, rendered the conditions insufferable. The hotel's WiFi network was inoperable for all three days of the meeting forcing colleagues out to Starbucks to check email. Staff were pleasant and apologetic but provided non functional room keys, forgot requests and did not rise above the situation. The air conditioning failure may have been simple misfortune but the hotel's half hearted attempt to fix it rather than relocate our meeting was an error. It is a high quality venue and a trendy, modern central London meeting place but the technical issues have to be addressed for a hotel of this standing.","en"
"739",5,"Six of us stayed here for 2 nights in September to attend a wedding nearby. It is part of a Dutch hotel chain, with only 2 hotels in the UK, one in Glasgow, and the other here at Bankside in London. Design plays a key part in this hotel, everything in the rooms and open spaces has been thought through again from first principles. The reception desk isn't a desk, but a free standing island of computer screens with lots of staff around it to help. The rooms are small but so well laid out you don't notice. A tablet thing controls all functions in the room - lights, blinds, TV & alarm clock. I am more used to a fountain pen than a mouse, so it came as a challenge but I soon got used to it, and in the end it was fun. The bed is enormous, but can only be entered from one side, as it buts up against 2 walls and the window (which itself takes up an entire wall). My example of second to none customer service came at the bar. In the afternoon I asked the young lady behind the bar named Monica, for a ""Cafe Correcto"" (an espresso with a shot of Grappa in it). She had not heard of it, and had no Grappa, so could not give me this drink. She apologised profusely and said she would investigate for me. In the early evening, I again asked her for as ""Cafe Correcto"", and Monica said with a wonderful smile ""certainly sir, we went out a bought a bottle of Grappa for you and here is your drink at no charge, because we couldn't do it the first time”. Bravo Monica, and Bravo Citizen M for empowering her to make this happen. Whilst mentioning names, Enrique at reception deserves a special mention for his helpfulness on local directions to our wedding & reception venues. The open spaces in the hotel foyer and lounge area are great. It caters for smokers so well too, a very good idea. I used to be a smoker, and can appreciate the current problems. It's good value for money too for a central London location. Well done Citizen M.","en"

The hotel has 2 elevators, also quite small, one of them wasn't functional for the entire stay we were there.","en"
"746",3,"Booked this hotel via booking.com for a girls trip to London. Was too cheap to miss out on but didn't read reviews until after and was very close to cancelling it. Okay granted it is very basic and won't be winning awards anytime soon but considering the price you can't really complain. The location is pretty much perfect. Tube is about a 3 minute walk away. You have marks and spencer, boots, newsagents and food on the walk from the tube to the hotel and they open early and close late. The hotel is very small but suited us fine as we only wanted a shower and bed. Once we checked in we were told our room was a few doors down outside of the building which when you're carrying suitcases is a bit annoying but not the end of the world. Our room was a studio on the 4th floor. There is a lift available so again no hassles. Room was very small but served its purpose. 2 beds, tea and coffee, telephone, fan, safe and fridge and a bathroom. Our safe didn't seem to work so we just kept our suitcase locked with our belongings inside it. Our room was uncomfortably warm and we found it difficult to sleep. The weather was lovely when we were in London so I don't know if that was the cause or if it is always hot. That was probably our only real criticism. Basically, don't be put off by the negative reviews. If you want a hotel with all the frills go elsewhere and pay more money. If like me you're spending a few days in London and won't be in the room apart from showering and sleeping then it will serve its purpose. Close to tube and on the Piccadilly, district and circle lines and comfy beds. No problems throughout the stay.","en"
"747",5,"Stayed hear for 1 night, found by chance on booking.com. Very impressed by this lovely hotel, staff very friendly, continental breakfast included which is not always the case with a London hotel. We were lucky enough to be upgraded to an executive suite which was of a good size for London hotels. Hotel is approx 5 mins walk from Lancaster Gate tube station. Would recomend this hotel and will use again as very reasonably priced for London hotels.","en"
"748",5,"We arrived at 11am expecting to leave our luggage with the concierge but we were told we could book in straightaway. Our room did not have an opening window and I can't sleep with the window closed, but a quick word to the desk staff and we were not only moved to a room with an opening window but one with a balcony! We have always had a wonderful experience at the City and we were pleased to introduce my Brother and Sister in law who were really impressed with the style and the service. Well done guys!!","en"
"749",5,"I stayed here whilst on a trip to London recently the rooms are gorgeous and very comfortable the bathroom was great mine had a separate shower and bath and mood lighting. The food in the hotel was great. My only advice is to precook breakfast on arrival for £12 because they will charge you £18 should you decide on the morning. I would highly recommend and will definitely be back.","en"
"750",4,"Well, the title says it all. The service in the hotel is good. I also love their ambassador program! Stay away from the ballroom if there is a party they stay until late time and very loud. Also, try to ask for a hyde park view.","en"
"751",5,"I organised a trip to Hard Rock Calling concert in Hyde park for eight of us - chose this hotel from the previous tripadvisor reviews in our price range - we were not disappointed and my friends were all really pleased - we would all use this hotel again. Location near to Paddington and accessible to all tourist spots, really friendly staff who were happy to look after our luggage after check out until our train. Great breakfast an everything all absolutely spotless. We had fantastic weather for the concert, hottest weekend of the year! - only slight drawback was no air con but the hotel did provide fans.","en"
"752",1,"Booked a room on business for Wed 25th April a good month in advance and receieved confirmation emails etc. However upon arriving at 7.30pmpm (after a long day and 5hours in the car) was told they didnt have a room ready. When I refused to wait around as I had a meeting that evening they eventually found me a very low quality cramped room (dirty carpet) in a near by hotel and I finally magaed to check in around 9.15pm. The following day after my work day I had to return to the Reserve to collect my luggage when they presented me with a full bill. I objected to this but was told I would have to wait for an hour to see the manager as the assitant manager jad no power to alter charges although he offered me a free stay next time !","en"
"753",3,"This is a good place to stay with easy access to the rest of London. My room was large with a very big and modern on suit. The layout of the second building can be very confusing and is layed out in a very odd way .","en"
"754",3,"It's ok for one night........unless you are unlucky like we were and have thoughtless people in rooms nearby having very loud parties. We had a twin room overlooking the train line and at check in were told that we might experience noise from trains. This wasn't an issue, hardly heard them. However on arriving back from a gig at 11pm we were not impressed to hear the racket coming from the room two doors down and on the opposite side of the corridor to us, but thought once we were in the room we wouldn't hear it. WRONG!!!! Kept us awake until midnight with the screaming, laughing, shouting, slamming doors. Eventually all went quiet and we got to sleep, only to be woken at 4pm by the racket from the room next to us, sounded like they had come back in very drunk and had more than the 2 people that should have been in there. More racket until about 4.30am. Travelodge should do what Premier Inn do and have a Good Night Sleep Guarantee. On a plus side the room was clean, but the air con didn't work very well and the room was very hot, but if we opened the window then we did get noise from the trains and people. Not the fault of the hotel that they had noisy guests, but very annoying. Reception staff were very helpful, but not sure if I would stay again, have stayed in better Travelodges in Central London.","en"
"755",5,"I cannot believe what a bargain Clubquarters Gracechurch was! I agree with the other reviewers. We got £65 including tax on lastminute.com (approx. $130) which for London is unbelievable unless you're staying in a rat trap. The reason this place is so cheap I think is because it caters to Fortune 500 companies but only during the week and these companies have accounts which they pay heavily for. There were lots of business type people around. The room we got was just a standard double but VERY spacious for London and nicely decorated. Very clean and in great condition. The bed was really comfortable with a plush duvet. The bathroom only had a shower which was a disappointment but for what we paid we didn't mind one bit, especially as the shower had unlimited hot water and perfect pressure. They give you really expensive looking shower gel and shampoo which was a plus. Another perk of this hotel is that they have a contract with this special room service thing where you can get delivery from many great restaurants around London at very reasonable prices and they deliver it to your room. We didn't use the service but were impressed by it nonetheless. As far as the other reviewer who thought the lady behind the reception desk was rude, I thought the staff were really lovely all around. No problems at all. Speaking of reception, they have a great reception area with tables and nice leather chairs plus a small library of books and lots of newspapers and magazines and free coffee/tea/water throughout the day. The only possible bad thing about this place is that it's in the business/financial section of the city so it might not be good for people who've never visited London before and don't know their way around. But it is very close to Monument tube station and a short walk from Bank station connecting to all the tube lines. We loved the Clubquarters Gracechurch and couldn't believe what a bargain it was and will happily stay there again any time! Highly recommended!","en"
"756",5,"Stayed in Montcalm club room with daughter for girly weekend and concert at o2. lovely room, lovely breakfast, lovely staff. Felt nice safe area at night when returning back in evenings. loved quirkiness of hotel building. Easy to get to shopping areas and easy to get to o2. would love to come back to stay with my husband in future. had issue with tv on first night but it was sorted with an engineer in 10 minutes! will definitely recommend to friends wanting hotel in London.","en"
"757",3,"This hotel was used as a base for working at Excel for the week, which being a few hundred yards away made it an excellent location. The DLR is relatively close too. Open air car parking is also really easy (on-site) and included in the hotel price. The room itself was mostly fine, a crack in the front window made it look a little shabby. Spacious enough (family room). Bit of a lack of desk / table surfaces. There was also a noise overnight which sounded like a door being repeatedly slammed. Staff seemed unable to source / resolve the problem. We ate there once, which put us off eating there again. All courses were brought to the table at the same time (starter and main together - we hadn't asked for this) It was also apparent the food was all microwaved, including the chips which congealed shortly after being served. After a very long working day the food was disappointing. They also have an issue with something at Excel, which seems to wipe the room card keys, they needed resetting a few times over the course of the week. Wifi proved to be intermittent, only being available for 70% of the time we paid for. The airport is very close. Flights were operating from 7.00am to about 9.30pm, this can be very noticeable, but not an issue if you wake early. At the time of writing this, the DLR is undergoing some work (Crossrail), and access from the hotel into central London might be difficult due to the weekend closures","en"
"758",5,"Stayed at this hotel with my sister on a theatre break. Hotel rooms very comfortable, with lovely decor and very comfortable beds. Hotel is just off Oxford Street........great location for shopping. All the staff were very friendly and attentive, nothing was too much trouble which made our stay even more enjoyable. Breakfast was delicious with varied choices. Would highly recommend this hotel. Will be returning without a doubt.","en"
"759",5,"We stayed at the Kensington Close for 2 nights booking through Expedia with a good rate. The hotel was in a great location central to everything and just a short bus or tube ride away. As mentioned on previous reviews - the rooms are small but adequate and for a base to see London perfect...would recommend.","en"
"760",4,"Stayed for one night on business. Just off Oxford Street so location is great. Hotel is dated (bathrooms and common areas especially) but beds comfy, rooms clean, tea pots provided and I had an excellent meal in the restaurant on the 15th floor.","en"
"761",4,"Stayed here for four days in August in one of the two-bed apartments. Having the small but fully functional (dishwasher, toaster, kettle, etc) kitchen in the apartment was great especially around breakfast time as it saved having to either eat the hotel breakfast ($12 a head) or go out to find somewhere to eat. The layout of the apt. is a little strange; as others have noted it's hard to get a suitcase up the narrow twisty staircase, and it's not ideal to have the toilet downstairs and the bathroom upstairs. Speaking of upstairs, the two bedrooms are surprisingly spacious. The bathroom is not. Space concerns aside, let's be honest, you're staying here for the location. And it really is fantastically situated. You're a 2-minute walk from Trafalgar Square. 8-minute walk from Covent Garden. 10-minute walk across the Jubilee Bridge to the London Eye. Buckingham Palace is also just 10 minutes away. And if you need to jump on a Tube train, the Embankment station is literally just around the corner. Nobody visits London to stay in their hotel room but if I had one minor gripe it's that using the sofa bed as a sofa was impossible because the cushions kept slipping off. Front desk staff were friendly, took our bags from us about 3 hours before we could check in. Free coffee available. I've read other reviews that mentioned a lot of noise from the elevator. Have to say didn't hear any of that, be it mechanical or from loud guests. Citadines is certainly not cheap, but worth it for the location alone.","en"
"762",3,"stayed a night...was fine...but very small passages and rooms....wifi wont reach your room if your on the upper floors,though its free....very friendly staff and very good locations...near the kings cross station where you can find trains and undergrounds to every where in the city and intercity...would stay again","en"
"763",4,"The staff were very friendly and went out of their way to take care of my bicycle, which I hadn't told them I was bringing with me (I got a 'secret hotel' deal on the day of arrival). The room was fine, but as is often the case with the big chains, the access to wifi was stupidly expensive, and the free wifi in the bar / lounge area was creaking under the strain at 23.00 on a Sunday night (everyone in the bar was trying to get access and people were wandering around, looking for signal and swapping tales about how they managed to get logged on, albeit briefly).","en"
"764",5,"Excellent welcome by staff on checking in. Rooms clean witha fresh look. ( we had stayed here about 2 years ago so felt confident to return) All the staff were ready and willing to help - excellent team. We had full English cooked breakfast saturday and sunday,unfortunately Sunday's was cold and the plates were cold - possibly a one-off as Satuday's was hot. Not impressed that at breakfast as tables were cleared they were not sprayed but wiped with same cloth from the waitress's pocket! I expected better than this in London.","en"
"765",3,"Hotel rooms ok and quiet, bar food and service good, buffet breakfast ok but felt like they were cutting corners to save money. Good location for west london. Helpful reception and concierge staff. Expensive wifi in rooms","en"
"766",3,"when you book a room with a view - and you are told on booking in 'sorry all the rooms with views are gone', so they put you in a room 20 ft away from other windows and overlooking flat roofs and metal flue pipes etc. you know you are starting off at a disadvantage. The food didn't rescue the situation and it was poor value for money. Football blared out on every screen in the guest areas and bars. The only plus points I could make were the bar staff and one guy from the reception staff - the porter I think - the rest of the staff - hmmm - inefficient best sums them up. in short, in my opinion, this is a three star hotel, which is best left to the many groups of conference attendees.","en"
"767",5,"The Savoy, London, has impeccable pedigree in the league table that figures world's iconic hotels. The recent £100 million refurbishment may have brought the hotel into the 21st century, but the renewal sympathetically kept the old fashioned never-to-be-repeated charm of the bygone era. On my nephew's 26th birthday last week, we decided to give The American Bar at The Savoy a shot for post-lunch drinks. We chose this place after a bad 'no photographs in the bar here, sir' experience at The Ritz last year. What intellectual property right would a mere photograph or two have compromised? I thought hotels were public places, which welcomed/encouraged clients to click away with their cameras. After all, there is no better free publicity than customers' positive reviews. When we arrived at The American Bar, we were shown to a table without delay, The drinking hole, to use the vernacular, was abuzz with people animatedly chatting and sipping their drinks. The bar lived up to its reputation of not only serving the cocktails on the menu, but most other concoctions punters cared to order. We had frozen Margaritas and Restoration Celebrations, which were spot on. And, without prompting, the staff kept replenishing the olive dishes. At around £15 per drink, the cocktails are good value for money. Throw in the central location of the establishment, the reputation of the hotel, excellent service and happy drinkers, this is a must visit place. For us, The Ritz is out; The American Bar at The Savoy is in. Salud.","en"
"768",2,"Stayed 4 nights and found it very comfortable. The room was quiet and the staff more than willing to accommodate your wishes. Comfortable bed and elegant linens. Our room was very clean and my only complaint was that there was only one luggage rack.

"772",4,"This is the second time I have been to this hotel and like before everything was going perfect - great staff, nice hotel and fantastic location right next to the London Eye! However, this time I had problems getting into my room. I kept getting locked out which meant several trips to reception to sort the problem out as the key card would not work. This happened three or four times during my stay to the point that I was afraid to leave my room in case I could not get back in and this meant a waste of my money and time. I hated having to pester the staff at reception but even on one occasion they followed me to my room with a key that still would not work, then came back with a handful of other keys, of which only one of those worked! I would still come back here though as the staff are all lovely and it is a nice hotel and so handy for all the attractions. On check out I was informed that they were going to get someone in to look at the lock mechanism in the door so hopefully whoever else has that room does not have the same problems I had.","en"
"773",5,"We stayed here last year and nothing has changed. Still excellent service and clean comfortable rooms. Only critism I have is in the bathroom. We would like to see another ledge on top of the wash basin. Not enough room to store toiletries. Continental breakfast is very good.Thanks to all the staff who looked after us so well for our 8 night stay. Highly recommend this place and we will stay here again when we return to London.","en"
"774",5,"You've seen the TV ads so you know what a Premier Inn is all about. This particular one is located in a nice street just round the corner from Tower Bridge and the Tower of London and within easy reach of Tower Hill tube station. There is no on site parking but Minories car park around the corner offers 24 hour parking at £2/hour chargeable between 0600-1900. Check in was smooth and staff were helpful and welcoming. Our family room was as expected - clean and very spacious. There was a King Double which was very comfortable and two single beds for the kids which looked like 'proper' beds. Although the room faced the railway lines, we didn't hear a sound and got the good night's sleep that Premier Inn promises. Breakfast was great. The staff in the restaurant were helpful and attentive. There was a good range of foods and drinks on offer. The restaurant was quite small but at the time that we went to breakfast - 8 isn - it was not full or crowded. There is a small bar area which was adequate for a nightcap on returning to the hotel. The location of the hotel is great - your sightseeing starts almost as soon as you step outside with Tower Bridge and the Tower of London on the doorstep. Good walkers will be able to strike out on foot for many of London's main attractions. Premier Inn delivered what we expected it to - The staff ensure that you're well looked after. Factor in the Premier Location, it all adds up to a great choice for a London break.","en"
"775",2,"Overall a generally nice hotel, very close to the underground. However myself and my partner payed extra for a room which in the pictures on the website showed a sofa etc, lots of extra space... When we arrived, the room was extremely small, and was exactly as the standard rooms were pictured. We complained about this as we'd specifically paid extra for the larger, deluxe room and they simply shrugged it off by saying 'this is one of our deluxe rooms, you have a bath and a shower' (which is not something we cared about...) Disappointingly they refused to do anything about the situation, so we had to put up with it... upon complaining afterwards directly to the hotel group, they did offer compensation in the form of 'hotel points', however we don't really stay in these hotels usually so was pretty much a waste of time. If you're going to stay here, I'd suggest just paying for a standard room because chances are that's what you'll get anyway - don't pay extra!","en"
"776",1,"Firstly let me apologise on behalf of the Queens Park Hotel for the appalling stay you have just had (or will have), this incidentally is more than you will get from the Hotel itself if you choose to complain. I recently had the misfortune to stay in dreadful Hotel for six nights. The first sign that all was not well was when I checked in, man (otherwise know as the concierge) was slouched behind the reception desk slugging at a bottle of water and talking to the receptionist, both chose to ignore me and continue their riveting conversation whilst I waited to check in. The conversation continued between the pair whilst I checked in. Then came the lifts, filthy, cramped and generally unsafe looking with the same faults that have been flagged up for the past 4 years or more on TA, one being the unhygienic & unsafe carpeting. On arrival at the second floor there was no indication as to which room numbers were where, I set off in search of my room down claustrophobic, filthy and poorly maintained corridors. Incidentally it looked like the carpets hadn't been cleaned since the 80's. I eventually found the room and was truly shocked at its state of disrepair; the walls had dirty finger marks and huge scuffmarks around the room. The 70's bedclothes had a big cigarette burn in the middle with what can only be described as a bloodstain at the pillow area of the bed. I promptly returned to reception to complain and asked to be moved, this was treated with total silence from the staff member on reception as she banged away on her keyboard I then got the stock answer we are very busy so I only have a basement room to offer, so off to the basement room I marched to find a slightly larger room with no natural light and a smell like somebody/thing had died in the bathroom. In addition to this the safe was not working and the smoke alarm had been removed and stuffed in a draw (this was strangely rectified without me asking a day later!). The room also had no Fire instructions or booklet about phone numbers or hotel services which is standard in all the hotels I have ever stayed in. At this point I decided not to fight it anymore and grin and bare it (stupidly I know) - If I tried to check out I was told I would be charged 3 nights for a one-night stay!! On my second night I received a knock on the door from the afore mentioned man in casual clothing asking me who I was and when I was checking out, I assumed he was looking for a room to sleep in/smoke in. The only investment this hotel has appeared to have had over the past few years is on a shiny new reception area to paper over the cracks of the major problems it has. On returning to the hotel on my final there was a large stack of 32’ TV’s being delivered, so they are investing in the hotel but in all the wrong areas. There were lots of other problems that in countered whilst here, far too many to list. Please, please if your considering this hotel, don't, for your own Health & Wellbeing look elsewhere.","en"
"777",4,"Very centrally located. Easy to get to the Underground or the bus routes. Staff very friendly. Price good for the rooms and amenities. Free internet and the cookies are always nice addition.

"778",4,"Spent four nights here in mid June. The hotel is sort of off the beaten path in London but is in a very quiet neighborhood five minutes walk from Swiss Cottage Metro station. The hotel was nice, clean and was perfect for us. Remember most European hotels are not set up to be able to easily charge all of todays devices carried by a family of four but we made do with plenty of adapters and extension cords. The executive lounge was nice and always had food and cold drinks available. Breakfast buffet was nice as well. The hotel had a gym and pool but we did not use them, Staff was friendly. All in all a nice stay.","en"
"779",5,"I am usually reluctant to stay in a ""NON BRAND"" hotel - BUT! What a great surprise. Its location is ideal for central London. There are also many nearby Malls/shops.It is a very easy less than 20 min. walk to nearest tube. Normally when somewhere says you get a ""free"" breakfast, then you know you are not going to be getting much - BUT! Another great surprise! I could easily have eaten on the b. fast menu all day. The restaurant menu is all very good, what I would call ""home made quality"" cooking. My favorite type. Every member off staff were super nice and friendly/helpful. The room was very comfortable, and nicely kept. I do not like an ""in bath"" shower, so that is my only minor gripe! I do visit London quite often, and know without doubt that I shall be going back there to stay.","en"

"781",5,"ok you decide - here are the facts Booked a superior room - not a standard room - and paid several weeks in advance so the hotel had my money. On the day no call from the hotel so set off for South Kensington having booked a dinner for several friends near the hotel. Arrived. Was told that they had overbooked and there was no room for me. No explanation - just life. But we have booked a hotel room for you. Yes - it was at Chelsea Football Ground miles from the Cranley. Man who was dealing with this disappeared. Taxi driver finally shows - no idea where to go - not briefed by hotel. We scrabble our way there - to an anonymous block hotel miles from my dinner plans. Ring friends to cancel dinner and spend miserable night to be woken at 6.30 by sound of refuse trucks clearing the football stadium. Ring The Cranley expecting - as a 4 star 'luxury boutique hotel' - to compensate me for a completely ruined evening. No chance. At best we will give you a 20% discount although we totally acknowledge we overbooked - didn't get a hoped for cancellation so bounced you - hadn't notified you so wasted journey. Asked to speak to the Manager. Of course he will ring you immediately... Three days later - five ( yes 5 ) phone calls from me and no contact with the manager. Finally told by a woman 'speaking on his behalf' that 20% final offer. You decide. There are many excellent hotels I have stayed in in South Kensington like the Beaufort; The Kensington; The Egerton House Hotel - all great hotels with great customer service. Then there is the The Cranley which makes Faulty Towers seem like the Ritz Carlton. Your call.","en"

"785",4,"I stayed with my wife in January 2014. We got a deal for £124 inc breakfast per night over the weekend. We booked about three weeks in advance. Really great location. We caught a bus from Kings Cross to Lambeth North and it was less than 10 mins walk from the stop, great for avoiding the tube with luggage. Waterloo station is immediately behind, Lambeth North, Westminster, the stupidly expensive river boats and loads of bus routes are within easy walking distance of the hotel. On top of that, you have short walks to the South Bank, the West End, Covent Garden, and short tube journeys to all of the major Central London sites. The location really is excellent. We arrived very early so left our bags. Upon check in we were given a free upgrade to a 2 bedroom studio on the 13th floor. Way to big for us, it had two rooms, with a king bed in each, a kitchenette and a living room area. We had three 42"" plasma screens. We had an interior view, I was going to try and swing an upgrade to a Houses of Parliament view and I've heard others have had success - can't hurt to ask! We didn't because we'd already had being upgraded. Room was really nice. Only complaint really was shower water pressure which wasn't great. Great bath through. Really well lit, although the complex lighting controls get on your nerves even for a techy like me. Free wifi, 1mb only or you can pay to upgrade the speed. Temperature controls were very good and the aircon and heating are very effective. Interior view was actually quite nice, it's a very attractive lobby with large trees. Also some exterior views are less than glamorous, so don't be too disappointed if you get an interior view. We also visited the pool. Again, excellent facilities. Good changing area, quite small but adequate. Free towels here and lockers are free of charge. Lifts go directly to the Spa from rooms so quite a few people actually just go down in their robes. Swimming pool is really warm. It's not really a pool for doing lengths, it's a bit to warm. Spa music playing. It can get busy, we found Saturday afternoon though to be quiet, indeed we were the only ones in there at one point. Really good steam room and sauna as well. Only complaint, only four beds and people have a tendency to reserve with towels, on our second visit one couple saved ""theirs"" for over an hour while they were in the pool, sauna etc. Hotel could do with a policy to stop this as it's not fair on other guests. We didn't eat or drink at the hotel other than breakfast. I've visited the bar with business colleagues on a previous visit however and it is very nice. The have live music every night and on Saturday afternoon there was a lady playing the harp when we were there. We did eat breakfast at the hotel. This was at best ok, and there is plenty of room for improvement. Our second day was better than the first. The first day we were given the choice between a windowless basement room or a very, very cramped restaurant. We opted for the restaurant, let's put it this way, I knocked elbows with the gent sat next to me. The second day we were given a table in the lobby, believe it or not this was an improvement as we had a view of the Houses of Parliament. Buffet was average, nice to have salad as an option, other than that about the standard of Premier Inn, which I stay in a lot for work, hotel chains like Marriott do it far better so if a nice breakfast experience is for you then maybe don't eat at this hotel. That was really the only negative experience. The hotel is otherwise excellent. I would definitely stay here again, but would be happy with a room only rate next time. Check out very easy, just put our card in the express check out.","en"

The hotel is not that big and decoration is amazing ; the bar was our favorite place ! Restaurant really beautiful and breakfast was excellent even though toast was cold and butter frozen but juices were great and staff is quick and friendly. Rooms not to big but you are in London .....well decorated and extremely clever use of space. Fantastic bed and great shower and all amazing clean so what more do you need ?

Breakfast served in the room for a small surcharge - and very tasty. In Southampton Row, ideal for short walk to and from the Eurostar terminal. I will use it again.","en"
"788",5,"As others have mentioned, the hotel is easy to reach and well positioned. Booking in was swift, but sadly the room wasn't ready despite arriving after 2pm check in time. Rather dismayed to find a blocked toilet in the room and even more dismayed when reporting the problem at 6.50pm to be told that house keeping had left for the day and a vacant stare from the receptionist indicating it would be difficult to resolve. Leaving the problem to be rectified whilst we went for dinner nearby, how delightful it was to find that reception had indeed ""looked into the problem"" and a large plunger deposited in the room with no attempt made to clear the problem. Just love paying for accommodation to find blocked plumbing and sorting out the problem yourself!","en"
"789",2,"I've stayed in many a Travelodge over the years, and this has to be one of the worst. The rooms need a huge refurb and the lifts to your room feel like a ride at Alton Towers.

Will avoid this one on any future stay. Also it's not the nicest of area to be around late at night.","en"
"790",5,"The hotel is in a great location and perfect for a city break. The rooms have a tea station in a cupboard with a small sink, fridge and microwave. The sink has a filtered water tap which makes a nice change from bottled water and ensures a decent cup of tea in the morning! Had a great night sleep as the bed was big and comfortable. The staff at reception were very friendly. The room was very clean and of modern high end decor.very good wifi available.","en"

"794",5,"My Mum and I (she is 81) had travelled back from Italy to St Pancras, and had booked this hotel as we arrived into St Pancras quite late. My goodness - what a welcome! The porter came out of the hotel to greet us, and my Mum decided that he was her knight in shining armour at this stage, and said she could have hugged him when he took control over our baggage. We went into reception and were treated to a wonderful welcome from Thomas on reception. Our room was superb, so so comfortable. We showered in the lovely bathrooms, propped ourselves up in our comfy beds, and enjoyed catching up on a bit of TV and had a delightful nights sleep. Mum and I both said that this was an excellent ending to our beautiful holiday, and I would personally like to thank all the team at the Pullman for making our stay so enjoyable especially Thomas and the porter who initially greeted us. I would like to think we will return. Thank you.","en"
"795",5,"After reading many good reviews on trip advisor i decided to head to the indigo hotel with my 5 year old and my mother for two nights. Upon arriving i reminded the very friendly receptionist that i requested an extra bed for my daughter through booking.com. They informed me that they only have baby cots, which of course was not adequate for my 5 year old. So they offered me an upgrade to a junior suite with a large sofa to be used as an extra bed for an extra 50£/ night!! To my surprise, after upgrading they brought in an extra bed!! I thought they said they didn't have any extra beds!! So what does that mean!? I was not really happy to pay that extra 100£ for having a child in the room but i was tired after the flight and didn't want to argue so i accepted. Apart from that incident the hotel overall was nice, clean rooms and excellent location. Staff were all very friendly and tried their best to accommodate our requests. Breakfast buffet was average but the waiters failed to explain that most dishes were to be ordered from the menu. I would recommend this hotel to a couple for a solo traveller but not for a family.","en"

"798",4,"Stayed here in November for a very short honeymoon. Had a great time and loved the location. Probably my favourite Hilton in London. Staff in the hotel were pretty good and very polite. Breakfast was great and the Executive Lounge provided a good range of snacks in comfortable surroundings. Alcohol was available for only a few hours in the evening which was fine for us but some guests were complaining. I booked a couple of massages at the health club within the hotel. Having stayed at places the Cavalieri I was expecting something better than the offering at the Park Lane Hilton. To be honest it felt very downmarket and was a bit of a let down. Wouldn't recommend it. The only other disappointment was that having informed the hotel in advance that we were there for our honeymoon I had hoped for an upgrade or some welcome gesture. I have Diamond status but perhaps these extra touches are not done anymore. Finally, we have booked to go back to the hotel in February for a weekend and will make a point of visiting the bar on the top floor and fingers crossed we may finally get the upgrade!","en"
"799",4,"A lovely furnished hotel with a lot of well thought out details, though the room was a touch small. We had to ask for a second luggage rack and barely had space for the second bag. The bed was comfortable though the mattress was two twins joined, so we could feel it. The bed topper could have been better, but the linens were soft. One drawback for people with allergies is the carpet--plush but also feels like it is full of dust. Luckily the hotel provides slippers. Given that the renovations were completed three years ago, I wish the hotel had invested in hard floors. The bathroom floor was heated tile, which was lovely. First class toiletries and very prompt housekeeping service, what you would expect at this level of luxury. Turn down service was good, though I wonder if a mint on the pillow could not have added a little extra touch. For people with mobility problems, there are seven steps to get to the lobby. I withheld one star because we were not greeted at the entrance to take our bags. If I had been alone with a large bag, it would have been a problem. Note that they had valets but none was available when we arrived. During the three days here, I rarely saw one at the door. Umbrellas are available on loan from the hotel and were much appreciated. Plug adaptors can also be requested. There was no shortage of plugs to recharge electronics. Buffet breakfast was great and varied. The in-room minibar was stocked with complimentary sparkling water, juices and some soft drinks. A total treat and a lovely surprise. Overall, a very positive experience and, given the location, I would return.","en"
"800",4,"Stayed at the Victoria Inn Hotel for 5 nights in November. Location of hotel is excellent, its a 15 minute walk to Victoria Station and 5 mins walk from Pimlico Tube Station so very central. Also bus no. 24 goes by every couple of minutes, even in the evening. Breakfast in the morning was basic. The room were it is served was quite small and the quality of the food basic. Food supplies were not lacking, however I was disappointed to see that for example with the toast, no ham/salami were offered and cheese slices were only available during the weekend so one had to contend with either plain toast just with butter or jam. I had a single room, which was on the small side, but adequate if you only use the hotel as a base to change/shower/sleep. It was very clean. I asked for a room at the back of the hotel and on a higher floor after reading previous reviews. Only glitch was that like all properties in London, walls and doors are paper thin, so I could hear fellow guests coming and going all night as well as my neighbour snoring to his heart's content at night. I would also suggest you avoid the rooms on the same level as the breakfast room (-1 floor) as it does get very noisy in the morning. The shower in the room was a nightmare. One has to spend 5 minutes cowering in the corner until the running cold water warms up a bit. There was no in-between setting on the weird tap either, which meant that you either had to shower with freezing water or scalding water. Also the shower head/water pressure meant that the first thing that happened on opening the water was water spraying all over your face/hair. This may sound petty at face value, but was the most frustrating aspect of my stay and I ended up with blotches on my skin where I got scalded as well as soaking hair each day. On the whole, receptionists were very courteous and helpful, especially the older gentleman who went out of his way to be nice and offer his assistance. He is an asset to the hotel. After reading reviews of other hotels. some of which verged on the very worrying, I would probably stay at the Victoria Inn again, by which time they would hopefully have settled their shower issue.","en"
"801",4,"Welcoming: We arrived late and the receptionist has been very nice in welcoming us. Outside was very very cold and the colours of the entrance as well as its temperature make the hall very cozy. Room:We reserved a standard queen room for 5 nights. The room was too small for 2 people, the bed was attached to the wall on one side and it was not really confortable go sleeping.Finally we changed for a bigger (and more expensive) room were, of course, it was easyer go sleeping but no additional services were included than in the standard one. A part of the room size, everything was very clean, but the courtesy set (of the bath) was poor and simple, at least simpler than we expected considering the price/night. Moreover they don't offer you any courtesy water as, on the contrary, we found in other hotels in London of the same category. Both the rooms I occupied had no any view. neighborood: The hote is very well located,few step from scotland yard, buckingam palace, parliament square and the tube (St. James park station). Various: people are very nice and kind. In the the Caxton bar there are 2 caminos in front of which is very cozy and relaxing have a tea or a drink, chatting with some of the other guests.The breackfast is reach and good, fully furnished with both, continental and english types. Generally speaking I think that the Hotel is quit expensive for what it offers (as a standard and superior services - where to pay only for space) but it is a nice place in which to stay during your London experience.","en"
"802",2,"We were told in a very rude manner by the staff that we couldn't have a cup of tea and a snack that we had bought from Harrods cafe in the lobby. The hotel had a very separate dining area with tables that was separated from the main lobby by a set of doors which we were nowhere near. We were sitting by a window in the corner of the lobby. The only reason we brought our food back to the hotel is because we couldn't find anywhere to sit in Harrods or anywhere to sit in between, every place was packed with tourists as is usual for a Saturday during summer holidays in London. While we were outside our 5 year old got stung by a wasp. We thought we would retreat back to what should have been the safety and comfort of the hotel we paid for but instead were rudely asked by staff if we had a room there and when we said yes, we are guests, we were rudely told that we can't eat in the lobby and that if we had to eat we would have to do so in our room. The same room our boys had spent all morning cooped up in with their babysitter because we had to attend a wedding ceremony that didn't allow children that day. They needed a break and we took them out but then couldn't find a place to sit and eat our snack so we assumed we would be safe in the hotel lobby we paid for, and this hotel is quite expensive for what it is as well. By the way there were absolutely no signs anywhere in the lobby stating that guests can't eat in the lobby (keeping in mind it was not a five course meal - it was tea and pastries.) As we were heading up to our room, a little confused and embarrassed from having been evicted from our own lobby, we pointed out that there were no signs up stating guests can't eat or drink in the lobby ...this ended up with the staff shrugging and giving us rude looks and stating that no hotel lobby would allow guests to eat in their lobby. I believe if the hotel hasn't put the lobby seating and tables in for guest use they should probably just take these options for guest ""comfort"" out because really guests are not made to feel comfortable in the lobby anyway. At the very least put a sign up stating clearly that guests cannot eat or drink in the lobby. Our children were sitting very quietly, the lobby was empty aside from staff at the desk and one staff member lingering around to glare at us and it was a very disappointing situation for us to have been asked to move remove our entire family (two children 5 and 3) over such a silly rule that was not signposted anyway. The reason we gave this hotel a ""poor"" instead of a ""terrible"" rating was because the location is quite convenient but this hotel is expensive for what it is, our room was cramped and had a funny smell, especially the bathroom and the staff who handled this lobby ""issue"" were incredibly rude and condescending. Very sad to give such a review as we don't normally do this kind of thing.","en"
"803",4,"The location was excellent, walking distance from the station and also easy walk to Big Ben etc. Room was beautiful, well maintained, finishing touches were fantastic and the little added extra of the welcome card and chocolate cake was something unexpected! :) The concierge were always very helpful and friendly...however the reception team seemed rather stressed and not wanting to be working. Talking to colleague about something different whilst I was half way through my check in...I was kind of left questioning as to what was going on? No information on breakfast or spa area etc...however this was rectified by the lovely concierge who brought our luggage to the room immediately after check in. Sort your reception team out and this would be in my opinion one of the best hotels around the Westminster area. Well Done!","en"

"807",1,"When I arrived later a night (single woman travelling), the hotel ""manager"" told me a waterpipe had broken, so my room was not available. What a big lie! He had largely overbooked his hotel because of Wimbledon (confirmed by a staff member), so he said he had another room for me somewhere in the center and he could drive me there (no thanks, I want a cab!!) I arrived in a private apartment from somebody who had left the boxes with private stuff in front of the door. The key I was given opened all 3 flats in the house so I was scared that the other people too had a general key and could open my door! No ligh bulbt in the bathroom (is there a webcam filming me from the corridor?), few toilet paper, cupboards broken, no phone, no Internet, just the 3 flats in one house and I stayed in last floor = SCARY!!! I barricaded the door and I was still scared. A real nightmare! I have never experienced this! I should have stayed in the waiting room in the train station. Of course I had to pay the same as for the hotel room.","en"

"809",3,"This hotel is relatively affordable as it goes for London Hotel's and so that is a strong benefit. It also located right next to the Tower London which is also nice, but it is a train ride from the sites in Central London. The problem from our experience were multiple: 1. Poor Service - We traveled all over Europe and ironically, we had the most difficult time communicating with the staff here! To be clear, English is out native language. 2. Poor Breakfast - Our room did not include breakfast but a family member decided to have it there anyway. Bad idea. 3. Unfriendly pool - We were there with the family and one appeal is the pool. Sadly the pool is NOT kid friendly and kids are not allowed to use it for most of the day. Really disappointing that they discriminate against children. Anyway to summarize, the hotel is only okay and is in an okay location. The biggest redeeming factor is the cost and for many that could be a sufficient reason to stay there. I would look harder to find an alternative next time I travel with the family. I might feel otherwise if I was traveling for business.","en"

When we tried to use it, there was only one washer operating and folks were in line to use it. Also, the operating instructions were a little difficult to follow. However, there were 3 dryers available once you could get your clothes washed. Bottom line, excellent hotel with a great location. We would stay again!","en"

"818",1,"This is a different type of review, solely about customer service and courtesy which will become apparent later!! Made a booking for this hotel at the end of march/beginning april for a 1 night stay for myself and my son(15) as we were going to the FA cup final. Arrived at the hotel early as we wanted to leave our bag and get something to eat before our 1PM CHECK IN!. On arrival were told that as the hotel had overbooked we have been allocated a room in another hotel!!! 5 mins walk around the corner. we were offered a taxi to take us but as it was only 5!!! mins away we decided to walk, arrived at the hotel 20!!! mins later only to be told we could leave our bag but would not be able to check in until 2pm!!. giving us very little time to check in and depart for wembley!! On arriving back at the hotel at 2pm to check in We were then led from the hotel to another building some 6 or 7 doors away to a top floor TINY studio apartment with a double bed and hardly enough room to turn around, when we informed the man who took us to our room that we booked a twin room we were informed they didnt do twin rooms so it was a double or nothing!! After speaking to my son (who wasnt too keen on sharing a bed with his dad) and knowing how difficult it might be to find another hotel as most had been booked up we decided to bite the bullet and stay. We arrived back at the hotel at 9PM and went to reception to enquire about where to go for breakfast the following morning only to be told we would have to go back to the original hotel as they didnt do breakfast! Then the door on our room wouldnt lock and not wanting to have to go to reception 7 doors away in the rain we decided to just wedge something against the door for security. The bed was the most uncomfortable i have ever stayed in and the noise from outside was deafening with traffic and sirens, We never we back to the Regency house for breakfast as we could'nt be bothered walking back there. To conclude; Here is a message to the Regency house hotel,, IF I TRY TO BOOK A ROOM WITH YOU AND YOUR FULL OR IF YOU OVERBOOK TELL ME, OR CONTACT ME AT MY EMAIL ADDRESS WHICH YOU HAD, OR VIA MY MOBILE NUMBER WHICH YOU HAD, DON'T DECIDE TO BOOK ME A ROOM IN A DIFFERENT HOTEL, I'VE TRAVELLED THE WORLD AND AM MORE THAN CAPABLE OF BOOKING MY OWN ROOM, If you book at this hotel, give them a ring before arrival to check you are actually staying there as they might decide to put you somewere else!!

"819",2,"I stayed for three nights in a standard room. The good The staff are very helpful and friendly The room was very good with excellent shower and comfortable bed The quality of the furnishing was high Breakfast is very good which lots of choice from healthy to meals that will keep you going all day The bad The only let down was the evening meal. I chose steak pie and mash and regretted it. It cost 50% more than at a pub or restaurant close by but the quality and sloppiness of the cooking was beyond belief. The pie was a packet pie or average quality and the mashed potato was instant potato. I complained to the waiter who said he would tell the chef but the waiter did not offer any redress. This complaint is justified because many visitors will be visiting London for the first time and do not deserve this poor standard. What would have been five stars for this hotel is downgraded to three stars because of the very poor performance of the evening meal. If this hotel can improve the evening meals it will deserve five stars. All the chef needs to do if visit a few local pubs and restaurants to see how to prepare these dishes and then improve on this in order the justify the higher price charged.","en"
"820",5,"Reading previous reviews we had quite mixed expectations for staying at King's Cross Premier Inn. Could not get any confirmation about the room (twinbed and quiet) in advance - which was strange as usually hotels are happy to assist. We ""pre-checked-in"" at 10 in the morning and the (very friendly) clerk somehow added us on some list with the request of quiet room and twin beds. Which was what we got! Altough there was just 10cm space to separate the beds because of the fixed night tables. Beds were really high!!! Almost needed a ladder to climb up. Room 319 facing the courtyard was very quiet, but high enough for the window to open to fresh air. No pretty view, but we were not wanting to sit & stare out anyways... Room was smallish, standard size for a city hotel. The carpeting was old and patched, looked clean though. Aircon/ heating worked ok. Did not like the bath tub, would had prefered shower AND a hand shower - not wanting to wash hair every day. Breakfast was good. Only missing cheese, which we found strange, used to having it. With wifi we had problems, I guess the whole system crashed somehow. Were promised back the 6 pounds we paid (need individual pin codes if two persons with two iPhones or other device). Waiting to recieve the Visa bill to see if the amount really has been taken out. Sorting out this took AGES, the staff beng very friendly, but still, way too slow for it was not our fault.","en"

"826",4,"Agree with other reviewers about this Holiday Inn Express location as a cheap and cheerful base for a business or leisure trip to London. With a Priority Club advance purchase promotion I got B&B for about £40 a night which is excellent value for a hotel so close to central London. Handily located next to North Acton tube, the only thing worth pointing out is that this suburb is not the most attractive area of West London and, other than a small Tesco Express store and a couple of independent take-aways / eateries, there's nothing else of note in the immediate area. Some might even describe the largely commercial district as a little threatening, especially by night, and I'd not recommend it for lone female travellers as the short walk from the tube station, whilst well lit, takes you behind the hotel and some commercial properties on a ramp / steps which can't be seen from the (quiet) road on which the hotel is located. Five minutes on the tube though back towards London (alight at Shepherd's Bush) and you have all the eating and shopping you need at the fabulous Westfield London shopping mall. Definitely worth considering if you need to 'do' London on a shoestring.","en"

"831",3,"The reception area is ultra modern but too clinical, as are all the public area's and restaurants, almost cold. The Garry Rhodes brasserie is just a collection of tables in a room adjacent to the bar with the same very high ceilings as the rest of the ground floor, although I can't comment on the food because we didn't fancy the surroundings. Breakfast was very good but I wouldn't pay over £20 to sit in a 'Canteen' if it had not been part of our package. It was our room that was the most disappointing part of our stay, I appreciate the stay was part of a weekend package from a weekend break company but our room was the smallest I've ever stayed in in any city in the word, the bed was up against the wall and under the television so only one side of the bed was accessible which wasn't much fun when the wall side person needed the bathroom through night, not my idea of a comfortable stay.

"833",2,"Last month my wife and I traveled to London to pick up a cruise. We needed a place to stay for 1 night prior to traveling to the ship. We are theater geeks so we wanted to stay in a hotel close to the theater district thus the Radisson Edwardian Hampshire. When we arrived at the hotel after a 10 hour flight we were ready to enjoy the 5 star luxury promised in their advertisement. To our surprise the hotel clerk was sorry to say they were over sold and we had no room. I mentioned I prepaid the room and how could they give it to someone else. They didn't have an answer other than it was a computer problem and that there was nothing they could do. After a little scene I was able to convince them they needed to do something and so they got us a room at a sister hotel around the corner. It was okay and they gave us free breakfast and a bottle of wine. Yes they tried to make lemonade out of lemons but the simple fact is they took my money and gave me an inferior room in a lower quality hotel. Don't waste time pre-paying it doesn't matter with these people. To contrast that a couple of weeks later we showed up late in another hotel in Amsterdam and they said why were we worried we had pre-paid the room and it was waiting for us whenever we arrived.","en"

I was with work not that this makes it any better but was amazed at how busy it was.

"837",2,"My husband, 20-year-old daughter and I recently stayed at the Novotel Paddington and found it quite uncomfortable for a party of three. The room had one Queen bed (with a very thin, hard mattress) and a pull-out sofa bed, which we knew when we booked it. What we didn't know was that these two items pretty much filled the room. There was very little closet space (I counted seven hangers but not really room in the closet to hang seven garments) and no drawer space whatsoever. We ended up having to leave most of our belongings in our suitcasesThe bathroom was among the smallest I have ever encountered, with a phone-booth-sized shower that flooded the bathroom whenever it was used. The toilet was in a separate tiny room, painted stark white with a light that barely worked. There wasn't even a hook on the bathroom door to hang a robe. The decor is very spartan, to say the least. The room wasn't particularly clean, either, and it was very hot because the air conditioning wasn't working -- a fact I reported to the front desk to no avail. The complimentary buffet breakfast was okay, but the eggs and bacon tasted strange. The location is not bad in terms of its proximity to Paddington tube station, but is very difficult to get to by car or taxi and feels kind of inhospitable because it is surrounded by office buildings. The staff seemed to be trying hard, but many of them struggled with English and the restaurant, in particular during off-hours, was woefully understaffed.","en"
"838",1,"Where to begin? I paid £240 for a so-called ""luxury"" class room for one night on a business visit to London. My experience was horrific. It was my first, and will be my last, visit to a Hilton-brand hotel. • The queuing times were very long. I waited a total of 25-30 minutes in queues just to check in. My room wasn't ready upon the first attempt at check-in so I had to come back later. • The whole hotel - except the modern lobby which acts as a facade - is in horrible condition. It looks like it was refurbished a few decades ago (and probably was). There's paint and wallpaper peeling everywhere - in the corridors, around the elevators, on all the doors (especially the corridor access doors), and especially in the rooms. • The rooms were equally terrible. They smelled bad. The carpets, walls, and furnishings were worn and used. The bathroom was mouldy, with cracked tiles, peeling paintwork, and loose fixtures and fittings. • Everything was old-fashioned. You could tell that hundreds of people had used your room before you... not a comforting thought. • Your £240 will *not* get you free WiFi. Nice touch, Hilton! • The room shared a (locked) interior door with another adjoining room. I could hear the occupants very clearly, which was annoying when trying to sleep, and quite unsettling. I'd rather not think I'm only a door away from someone else while sleeping, you know? • There are no stairs. Only slow elevators. I did complain about my room to staff. I was unsatisfied at having shelled out £240 for a ""luxury"" room which was in a worse state than any Travelodge. To their credit, the staff were helpful, and I was offered either a reduction in my room rate, or a night in one of their ""suites"". Unbelievably, the suite (which presumably costs £600+ per night?) was equally terrible. Just take a look at my pictures - the tiny shower in the bathroom was in a horrible state, and the whole room smelled so stale and old once again. It was like a suite you'd find in your grandmother's Glasgow tenement block. The only difference was it had two TVs and a living area with couches. I disappointingly complained once again and was returned to my original room. Let me tell you, categorically, to avoid this hotel. I stay in London very regularly (for work) and have sampled a few hotels near Edgware Road. This has been by far the most disappointing. Sure, if I'd paid £70 a night, it might have been passable. But advertised as ""luxury"" and at £240, it's absolutely laughable. Take a look at my pictures and see for yourself. And if you're considering a stay in the area, go somewhere else. There's the Tune Hotel a few yards away, which at £70 a night is leagues better if you don't need extra facilities. There's also the Indigo Hotel, or even a Travelodge.","en"
"839",2,"We stayed in this hotel several times throughout our stay in the UK as the location is great. Paddington Station is very close, as are loads of cafes, pubs and restaurants as this is a very high density hotel area. Hyde Park is also very near and lovely way to wake up. Breakfast is very basic, but the serving staff were very friendly and polite. The room was very clean, and also very basic. The only complaint I would make is the pillows are dreadful - if you are a fusy sleeper I would recommend bringing your own as even the spare pillows are old, flat and lumpy - this was in all three rooms we stayed in, not just one. If you have a lot of luggage, or may have trouble carrying luggage up or down stairs request a ground floor room as there is no lift - this was no issue for us, but as the builing goes up several flights it may prove a hassel to some. Appart from the pillow issue, would definitely stay here again.","en"

"841",4,"Stayed here for a 4 days business trip. Have stayed at multiple Accor hotel around the world and can only say that this is a standard Novotel one, not better or worse. Which means fairly large rooms with simplistic interiors and service that is professional but never overhelming. The real benefit with this hotel is the location combined with good prices (you are in London where a rathole to a hotel can cost a fortune). You get a tidy room and a good breakfast and of you go to where in London city... basically. Would recommend this hotel to any business traveler that needs a good place to sleep, close to the nice locations and with business nearby. Also to families with a restricted budget but still wants to be located fairly central and thinks cleaningness and a good room winns over ""old english"" charm.","en"

There is no air con but a fan is provided if needed. All the staff were both very pleasant and efficient - breakfast worked like a well oiled machine in terms of service.

The room I had was pleasant, not ultra modern but very clean with effective double glazing. The disappointment was breakfast. In a relatively small hotel I would expect to be able to get a hot breakfast relatively easily. Sadly the ""hot"" breakfast was served in a lamp heated servery in dishes which had no warming elements. The result was a cold breakfast. Not good enough I am afraid and I was met with a shrug when I mentioned this to the waitress. If you can't serve hot food in the way it was intended then stick to continental breakfast. Heaven knows what nasty bugs lurk in hot food kept luke warm.","en"

Quite a large and spacious hotel but restaurant facilities relatively limited in relation to size of hotel. Breakfast (6.30 ‒ 10.30am) very good and staff very efficient. Lunch/dinner menus not very appealing compared with a visit several years ago. Bar very expensive (£18 for 3 drinks). Stay part of a package deal, including travel, so cost reasonable.","en"

You can't beat the location which is perfect, but with the benefit of being in a quiet cut-de-sac. When I was there the whole hotel was decorated beautifully for the holidays. There are also some wonderful public spaces. The only thing to be aware of is that being a guest does not automatically grant you access to things like the bowling alley or the restaurant for tea .... So if you have your heart set on doing something in particular, try to arrange it in advance of your stay.","en"
"852",5,"This hotel is still owned by the Goring family, and it has all the characteristics of a well-loved family establishment. (Take some time to read Tales from the Goring, an amusing history of the hotel. There's a copy in every room.) Some of the rooms feel a bit faded -- or comfortably old-fashioned, depending on your perspective -- but the bathrooms are good. The service is top notch; very professional and accommodating. Apparently, a new generation of Gorings has taken the reins. The dining room has been superbly updated by none other than David Linley (Princess Margaret's son). Maybe the bedrooms will be updated as well, but I suspect the regular guests wouldn't hear of it! The Goring has heaps of English character, good service, a wonderful location, and an impressive history. If you value these things, then it's worth the steep price. If you'd prefer a much more modern take on ""Britishness,"" you might like the Soho hotel, which costs about the same. P.S. We had great meals at two nearby restaurants, Thomas Cubitt and the Ebury Wine Bar.","en"
"853",4,"We had a two-night break (going to see the musical Matilda, which is highly recommended) in London and stayed at the Ambassadors Bloomsbury. We thought it was absolutely fine. It was convenient (being near to St.Pancras station) for us beig situated at Woburn Place, which transforms into Southampton Row after a while and leads you (if you are going to take a trek by foot) right down to Tottenham Court Rd. The one criticism of the place is that the rooms are small, at least ours was, and that meant that there was not very much storage space for clothes,etc. In fact, when it came to hanging space for jackets and coats, think of depth rather than width; there was a minute hanging area (probably a foot deep) with 4 (yes, just 4) hangers and imagine the hangers being fully horizontal rather than the customary being at right angles to you. Don't go there with plenty of posh frocks! You'd never manage. Also, there was no real drawer space. We had to use our suitcase and / or the bedside cabinets (one of which was filled with the inevitable kettle,etc) for storing undies, knitwear and other clothing items. Nice room, good bed, decent washroom (shower, no bath) but not enough space for all your clothes. Really nice breakfast menu. Pleasant enough breakfast area / restaurant / bar on the ground floor. Seemed to be a popular choice for business folks.","en"

The hotel is very conveniently located, minutes walk from Waterloo and Westminster Underground Stations and next door to the London Eye. The hotel itself is lovely, very new looking still, modern and clean. Though the hotel was very busy, when we got to our rooms you would never know, silence! The room was large with a double sofa bed, 2 flatscreen TV's, kettle, cups, glasses and a microwave and very elegantly decorated with lovely Elemis goodies in the bathroom. We had breakfast the next morning, and it was packed, so much so we were carted off to a downstairs room which was also packed full of wayward children. To be fair it was the weekend, and the staff were very professional in trying to handle them!! The breakfast was great, hot options including an egg station, and lots of pastries, cereals and fruit etc. This is now my go to hotel for London, it has everything you want for a reasonable price considering how nice it is.","en"

We came back late evening to collect our room keys and everything worked fine. While we were retrieving our bags, my daughter went to the bar to start ordering drinks for us, before she left to go home. A surley barman named Daniel Josif made this experience very unpleasant by being rude and intimidating to my daughter, he lost his professional standing totally and went away to allow a young lady to finish the order.","en"

"859",4,"When me and my husband first came into the hotel bedroom it was extremely cold to the point I was shivering and realised that there was a heater/air cooler so when I turned it on it said in writing above the heater if i turn the heating below 20 degrees it'll heat the room and if i turn the heating more than 20 degrees the room will cool. As it's winter I obviously wanted the heater on and thought it was ridiculous. Also, there's no shampoo or shower gel to wash with and no flannels. Another problem was when we got put on the 7th floor we were put on the left side and heard construction work outside at 8 am from all the way from the bottom to the top of the hotel in the morning which woke me up but thankfully, my husband complained to one of the hotel staff and she moved us to the right side of the hotel and didn't hear anything loud. 3rd problem was the canteen is ridiculous being open from 6 am till just 10:30 with the price of the ""breakfast"" being £20 each person, self served and basic and you have to pay for the drinks from the fridges even though the ""budget"" hotel cost us £138 and the food wasn't even worth £20. Luckily, we only had to stay 2 days from the 5th to the 7th but next time we will definitely try to go to travel lodge or premium Inn.","en"
"860",2,"Location was a bonus but that was it really. Room newly refurbished. Staff said they were only 2 months old. However the window had no latch so every time we tried to shut the window it would just fall down that led to us having no sleep for 2 days because of the street noise. Also the shower doors wouldn't close properly so every time we had a shower the bathroom floor was covered in water. We had to go across the road to the other hotel for breakfast however the staff were very rude in the restaurant. And always spoke foreign to each other which I felt was rude. When we checked out we spoke to the guy behind the desk who was also very rude and didn't seem to take in what we were saying and felt like he was making out we were lieing about what we said about the rooms and that we are the first ones to complain. My and my partner both work in the hotel industry and we know how to speak to guests and what to expect for the price we paid. Wouldn't recommend to friends and family.

"861",2,"Before I booked this hotel I made an extensive search for London hotels. We wanted a clean, modern place, close to a tube station. Hotels in the centre of the city were all horrendously expensive. We chose the Ibis Euston because it was next to the tube station, and situated North of the centre. It was definitely not the cheapest 3-star hotel available. This hotel is fine for business travellers on a budget, who only want to overnight - or people with zero expectations. We stayed there for 8 nights. - The room was absolutely, absolutely basic. I.e it has a bed, a TV, loo, bath/shower, washbasin, a railing to hang clothes, shelves, and a wireless keyboard. - No shampoo, no hairdryer. 2 small, thin towels, and a small thin floor towel. 1 teeny little soap. 2 plastic water glasses. A soap dispenser which sort of worked. A bed with a sheet, duvet, and 2 pillows. The usual hotel guides on where, what and how. Nothing else. Not even a picture on the wall. It did not have a complimentary newspaper or a coffee/tea-maker in the room, as reported by other websites. - Other reviewers commented that the wireless connection is impossibly slow. True. - The room was small. We could not stand beside each other at the foot of the bed. We shuffled to the bathroom one at a time. - There is nothing to see. Our room faced a backyard and brick wall. - The term used on the Ibis website to describe the room is ""aircooled"". They mean it. The room was not ""airconditioned"". Fiddling with a little knob on the wall made zero difference to the temperature. The window only opened a little bit so we propped it open with a rolled-up magazine. - You could feel the vibration of the trains pulling into the tube all the time. This stops only for a few hours late at night. - The hotel loads its trucks directly under the rooms - starting at about 06:00 in the morrnings. - Other reviewers commented that the breakfast is inedible. True. We tried it once. It included things that may have been eggs...or possibly hash browns... or flapjacks? Thereafter, we ate breakfast at the Subway bar at the station across the road at a third of the price, or at the Italian bistro next to that. Pretty good coffee and good service in both places. On the good side (which is why I almost gave it 3 stars): - The room was very clean and worked perfectly. - The bathroom was pristine every day, even though the bath's fascia was loose and the shower curtain a bit mouldy. - There was plenty of loo paper every day. - The bed was made fresh every day. - There was plentry of hot water and good water pressure in the shower. - The hotel as a whole seemed to be efficient and in good repair. - The location of the hotel is really extremely convenient and cut our travel costs considerably. Right next to the station is a small Nepalese restaurant (""The Great Nepalese Restaurant"") - which is unimpressive from the outside, but actually great. Personally I though the room was not worth the cost (more than 80 pounds per room.) We booked into an hotel close to Heathrow for considerably less, and was delighted with a large, lovely room with a range of bathroom goodies, a bed to die for and even complimentary hot chocolate, bottled water, juice and magazines. And really good food in the hotel restaurant. Check that little picture on the Ibis website of a room ...look carefully. As bare and small as it is on the photos, so bare and small it is in reality.","en"

"864",4,"I traveled, along with a coworker, from Mexico to attend a tradeshow at the Excel Centre. We arrived into Gatwick at 6 am and we were at the hotel by about 7 am. We understood our room wouldn't be available until later in the day, but in years past, in other hotels we were able to leave our bags and go out and wander around. At this property we were unable to do that and literally sat in the lobby/restaurant with our based while other guests were eating breakfast. After having been on the road for over 16 hours our inability to actually go somewhere was a problem. Had we been made aware we wouldn't be able to leave our bags we probably would have rented the previous night to have the rooms waiting for us upon our arrival. For long haul travel I don't usually bring a hair dryer and unfortunately all the loaner dryers were provided to guests who apparantely held on to them until their departure as I could never get one. Also, I've never stayed in a room without a telephone, simply for safety reasons, should someone try to break in to your room or if your feeling ill, you should be able to call downstairs. So you ask, why a 4 star, Location, Location, Location. The location was awesome, so convenient to be traveling the DLR in the oppositie direction than the rest of the masses of people arriving at the Excel Centre. Cleanliness was great and staff was very friendly. Breakfast was only so/so, for approx the same cost we had many other choices at the Excel Centre and ate our breakfast there.","en"

"866",5,"A great hotel for the price, and good value for central London. Our room, number 40, was spotlessly clean and quite a bit larger than expected - I think they had possibly given us a family room as I had asked for twin beds, being with my teenage son. There was absolutely no road noise but there was a continuous low thrum, possibly from heating ducts - however as it was continuous and monotone we found it didn't disturb sleep. There was also no noise from anywhere else in the hotel, possibly because it was right at the back. The hotel is only five minutes walk from Earls Court tube and about 20-30 mins walk straight along the road to the museums, very easy to do and quite pleasant as the area is very nice! We didn't eat in the hotel as there are numerous restaurants on Earls Court Road round the corner, but there is an on-site restaurant. My only slight downer was that computer issues (I think) meant we didn't get our room key for several hours, after we had been out to eat and come back, which made me slightly wary, but all was fine on our return. Staff were very helpful and apologetic about this issue. Overall, I would definitely return here on any overnight stay in London - it's a great budget hotel in a nice area close to useful transport links.","en"
"867",3,"Booking in was a nightmare. I had a reservation but the staff had no rooms available and after lots of running up and down stairs by staff trying to find out which rooms had been cleaned/did not have anyone already booked in they finally found us something. The hot breakfast was not good. There was insufficient space too keep warm all of the food that they put out. The food just sat on the side and gradually cooled, a lot of it was not properly cooked anyway. The waitress went to the kitchen and got the 'chef' to cook eggs on toast for me as the ones put out were both cold and not fully cooked [the whites were still slimy] and the toast machine only had one setting - undercooked. I put back the cold tomatoes and mushrooms and the raw hash browns. The bed was comfortable.","en"

We didn't have an evening meal here, as we had lots planned in the city, but would imagine it would be very good. Good location, walk down to Greenwich station if you need assistance or advice about travel plans/tickets, as Deptford bridge station is unmanned. Also, the river trips are 50% off if you show a travel card (daily train/bus ticket) and this is a nice way to get into the city centre. Would recommend this hotel to anyone.","en"
"869",2,"Stayed here last night 10th Dec and after a long day’s work was looking forward to a relaxing night and hearty breakfast in a supposed 4 star hotel. I checked in at 10:30pm and was allocated room 9063 on the 9th floor. I think these were the inferior rooms as I dread to think there was anything worse. The bathroom is from a 1950’s US motel – or at least that was what is seemed like to me. Cracked tiles on the floor, missing grout, a weird one piece sink, the hot and cold control for the bath was the wrong way round so spent 15mins running a lovely cold bath! After re-running the bath with hot water and a quick soak I went to bed. Someone had stolen the mattress and just left the base – no seriously I thought I was lying on just a base of concrete! Didn’t sleep well at all – pillows were like paper mache. After 6 hours of broken sleep my heart was lifted by the thought of a luxury hot full English breakfast. Unfortunately this too was a real let down. Juice from concentrate was very poor – but the main issue was the food was cold. Cold egg, cold bacon, cold beans, cold mushrooms, sausage was actually warm. I know these buffet style breakfasts are all the rage but most hotels manage to keep the food warm at least. Needless to say this is not a hotel you should choose to stay at – even if work select it for you I would go elsewhere!!","en"

"871",1,"On arrival the hotel looks fairly impressive, with the mable floors and pillars, once inside the true picture appears. On approaching the reception desk the receptionist turned her back on us and began to speak Spanish to another member of staff, She then picked up the phone without even giving a greeting or acknowledgement. Eventually we were able to get her attention and a key to store our luggage as the rooms were not available until after 1pm. We took a tube train from the near by Lancaster Gate Station and returned a few hours later. On entering our room the first thing I noticed was that it was tiny. with just enough space to sideways walk between the bed and the wall. On opening the wardrobe it was found to contain three hangers on the left side, on opening the right side of the wardrobe it was found to contain a wall. There were two bedside tables with tiny drawers in them and a dressing table will a 12"" clearance to the foot of the bed. Thrust underneath was a chair that had to be extracted to be able to pass the bottom of the bed. We tried to open the the drawers only to find they were glued shut. Therefore we had little room to store our clothes. A visit to the bathroom then posed a different problem, one had to limbo under the sink to be able to sit on the toilet and limbo back out to extract yourself. There were no refreshment facilities, nor glasses to get a drink of water from the tap in the bathroom. Feeling cramped I exited the room and took a stroll to the Bar...... only to find it was closed and remained so throughout the day and night, due to the staff saying that they did not have a licence. My relatives had problems with their room also, initially they were given a room that contained a put up bed, a spiral staircase up to nowhere and no wardrobe. They complained and were moved to another room whereby the double bed was pushed against the window wall, therfore no clear access to this side of the bed. They also encountered a problem with a nearby room window being left unlocked and banging against its frame throughout the night. Our visit to London was pleasant but we arrived back at the hotel in the early hours of the morning, only to be woken by room service banging on the door at 9am to service a room which we were not due out of until 11am. The continental breakfast was toast, croissants and cereal all of which was self service, the coffee was disgusting and the tea non-exisitant. As were the manners of the staff who continually glared at us as we tried to digest our food. On check out, no manners was again the tip of the day from the staff, who took the money and seemed eager to get rid of us. The feeling was mutual. I would not stay in this hotel again and feel the staff were rude and ignorant.","en"

I guess one small criticism would be the bathroom which was looking a wee bit tired and maybe could have used a little extra attention in those hard to reach spots. Not saying it was bad, but could have been a little better. The concierge service is very helpful and the close location of the London Bridge Station and the pier puts you in an excellent position for overground to Gatwick on Southern or FCC (much cheaper than the Gatwick, Victoria express and the same trip time), Underground Northern & Jubilee lines for Camden & the 02 and the ferry for the O2, Greenwich & Kew. There is also a 24 hour bus service from Leicester Square to Tooley Street by the station for the party animals amongst you. Being close to the station also means that there is never a shortage of taxis which the concierge is happy to hail for you. It is a busy spot and the Shard is being constructed next door, but there was no discernible noise in the room and I slept like a baby in the extremely comfortable bed. The Thames embankment is a mere stone's throw away and an excellent spot for a lazy Sunday walk. Good choice of breakfast foods which is the standard English fare with the usual continental twist. They do however cook an excellent omelet to order. All in all this is usually my first choice of hotel due to its friendly welcome, good rooms and excellent location. Not to mention its very reasonable pricing for a 4* London hotel.","en"
"874",3,"There is building work still going on at this hotel. We had drilling and hammering going on at 8am - not a great thing ! mentioned it at check and was just told ""oh sorry about that"" no offer of discount - even premier inn for fifty quid guarantees a quiet night..... Stayed here for a works function held in the ballroom. The check in was swift and efficient and the room excellent, great view, but the TV didn't work. Several phone calls and 6 hours later (nobody bothered to come up) we were offered another room - 10pm by this time. The bar is great with excellent entertainment Breakfast was not included in our room rate (£200/night) and was an additional £20 head. For £20 it was barely adequate - help yourself buffet of average quality items - personally wouldn't spend £40 on breakfast for two there again. My review sounds a bit negative, but it is actually a very impressive building, just not a £200/night hotel yet. If you can this for £150 including breakfast it would represent fair value.","en"
"875",5,"I commute to London every week and used to stay at the Four seasons in Mayfair but it got sterile and superficial after a while. I tried the Kensington Hotel and it was a completely new experience. Luxury with a personal touch. I bring the kids sometimes and they are taken care of like nowhere I have ever seen before (hot milk and cookies at the turn down service, a kitchen that will make whatever they ask for even if they have to run out and get it!). The concierge service holds very high standards (e.g. when my wife got sick, he had a doctor in the room within an hour on a Sunday morning in London!). The location is also perfect for the family with museums, restaurants and playgounds very close by. This is definitely a hidden gem!","en"
"876",4,"The Hotel is just across St Pancrass and Kings Cross station. If you catch the Eurostar to Europe early in the morning this is the place to stay. I slept in a newly renovated room. Very big double kingsize bed. Nice and clean the new bathroom. It is a bit overpriced. I paid 140GBP for one night without breakfast. Maybe it will be much cheaper after the Olympic Games. There was an aircondition but it was a bit to hot in the room. 7 out of ten.","en"
"877",5,"We stayed at The Montague on the Gardens just under a week ago. Location & services was fantastic. We travelled as a family with 2 children.

"880",4,"A stunning hotel adjacent to three railway stations. Beautiful rooms. We had a family room which was perfect for two smaller children to share the sofa bed in own area with TV. The public areas are very swish, liked the bowler hat light shades!!! Staff very attentive, nothing too much trouble. The only criticism was that the pillows were hard as rock!! Why? Both my husband and myself had stiff necks the following day. Next time I will request a soft pillow. This would have been a five star rating but for the bedding.","en"
"881",3,"This as I understand is a stab at a new kind of city hotel, smaller rooms with just the right amount of space, a bed, a shower and somewhere to swing a cat (just) with a lot of technology to assist with the stay, which would be great if the tech actually worked! The room size was OK, usually all I want is a bed and a shower, so this was fine and also suited the other travelers I spoke to in the lift. I have a minor grievance with the glass wall between the shower/loo and the bedroom, fine if I'm alone, but not if I'm travelling with another person - some privacy would be nice. I also noticed the metal coat hangers became hanging wind chimes if you so much as looked like you may want to use them, but apart from that the room was comfy and usable - except for one very important thing - the tech! The one panel that controls everything, heat, light, TV etc didn't seem to be connected to anything. I switched the cooling down from 22 to 18, when I came back into the room it was back at 22! I did it again and second time it worked. One of my colleagues couldn't switch the lights on and the other couldn't switch them off - so slept the entire night with them on (not ideal) None of us could get the TV to work at all. I'd think this was OK if we weren't all in the IT business and actually quite tech savvy, so I've no idea how others got on. Other travelers expressed the same feedback. All in all the downstairs 'common areas' dinning/eating etc was spot on and absolutely no complaints here, we thought it was a great use of space and much better than the norm. Sort the tech out and these hotels would be great places to stay on a city break!","en"
"882",5,"If first impressions count, then this must be a great hotel as the staff nearly fall over themselves to make you welcome. If you're looking at value for money, then it's up there with the best too: good location, clean quiet rooms, the only slight gripe would be that yo might need to bring a compass as the corridor system can be a tad confusing - but then, that's a pretty tiny complaint in the scale of things. We'll definitely be returning, if only to feel really important when the staff give you that genuine ""Hello, how can I help you?"" and you know they really mean it!","en"
"883",5,"My partner and I stayed here for one night. We were welcomed and shown around the magnificent hotel which is stunning. We were shown to our beautiful room which had a lovely bathroom, with all the toiletries you could wish for. The room overlooked the gorgeous courtyard, where a piànist was playing under the palm trees, just amazing. Nothing was too much trouble in this hotel, doormen, concierge, housekeeping, reception. ...all exceptional. My only criticism would be the restaurant 2 twenty 2, the service seemed a little slow, and disjointed for example the bread that we ordered didnt arrive, sweets served separately one arrived ten mins after the other.....this aside, the food was lovely. I would recommend this hotel to anyone, an absolutely fantastic weekend and made special by the wonderful teams within the hotel.","en"

"885",5,"My husband, 19 year old son and I stayed at this hotel for three nights before Easter. We paid for our stay using Marriott points and were initially told that we'd have one bed and a rollaway. Prior to our departure I let the hotel know that we preferred two beds and upon arrival found that our request had been honored in a room with a view of Big Ben and the London Eye. The room was large by London standards and was very comfortable with American style plug ins. The hotel staff told us that the main entrance will be open in June, so until then you still have to go to the side opposite the river to enter. Across from that entrance is a Subway sandwich shop that serves breakfast sandwiches at a reasonable price. Near the tube stop is a Tesco that sells Croissants and small grocery items for snacks in the room that are even more economical. The hotel rooms have tea, instant coffee and shortbreads available for quick pick me ups as well. Overall this is a lovely choice for a holiday hotel!","en"
"886",4,"We stayed at the premier inn for one night during our Christmas break as we bought tickets to see Disney on ice at the O2 arena with our 2 little kids. We arrived early on the Friday 27th as the information provided by premier inn when booking stated the car park would be same used for the Westfield Stratford shopping centre. As it was the sale days we thought it would be best to go early and get a parking spot. The easiest car park to use for the premier inn is Car Park A. We got to the car park at 10:30am and there were hardly any cars at the car park. We realised that the shopping centre does not get busy until after 11/11:30am, and so will bae that in mind for the next time we visit. The parking is £5 for 24 hours but after 24 hours go up on an hourly fee (I think about £2/per hour). Check-in to the hotel begins at 14:00 so we had plenty of time to visit shops and have something to eat. There are not many signs for the premier inn when you are in the shopping centre (we did see a couple of small ones but these can be easily missed) and you have to exit the doors walk around a corner to see the premier inn entrance. The ground floor entrance just has a few seats and 3 lifts to the higher floors. We checked-in on the 1st floor via the check-in monitors. There are no reception desks as we have seen at other hotels but I guess this is to reduce head count. There are a couple of staff sitting at monitors who can help with any issues but we checked in via the monitors and it was pain free. We were located on the 2nd floor and the room was of a good size and was very clean. There was one large double bed and 2 small singles in our room. We had requested a cot in our room for our 3-month baby and after approx. 5 minutes in our room we had a knock on our room asking if we wanted the cot put into the room. We didn’t need the cot as the baby would be fine sleeping on one of the single beds as he does not roll around yet. If we did have the cot erected, space would have become a bit of a problem. The bathroom was clean and tidy. The views from the window were nothing special apart was of the Olympic village accommodation buildings and the new DLR Stratford International station. It was warm in the room throughout our time in the hotel but we have become use to staying hot hotel rooms in most hotels. The room is basic and has a small LCD TV, tea and coffee facilities and a hard dryer. When entering/leaving the hotels using the lifts, you have to have a valid room key to activate the lift. This can be a bit of a problem considering a packed lift car and trying to use the card to activate the lift and selecting the buttons, but some people are nice and do it for you. You can use the stairs to enter/exit the building but there are 139 steps from the ground level to the 1st floor, so unless you are up for an exercise the lift is probably a better option. At night when we went to sleep it was a bit uncomfortable due to the heat but my wife did not allow me to turn on the air-con but I tried the settings and it did work. Check-out of the room was at midday on the Saturday and again it was pain free, we left the room went to the 1st floor and handed our room keys to the staff sitting behind monitors. The location of the hotel is perfect, very short walking distance to Westfield shopping centre and then has fantastic rail links, next to Stratford International for journeys into Europe or Kings Cross, the DLR, Jubilee line, Central line and the Overground! Can’t fault the location of this hotel!","en"
"887",4,"Walking to your room in this massive hotel, you expect to feel a slight pitch and smell the sea air. Although landlocked, this grand old hotel in the hear of the theatre district in London feels very much like an ocean liner. Long rather narrow halls, hundreds of rooms, and a rather flat color scheme give you the sense that you have stepped back decades. This didn't stop at my room, which was listed as ""cozy"" but initially felt postage stamp sized. After I got the heat and lights adjusted, it was, indeed cozy, and for the time that I spent in the hotel, perfectly fine. Besides the location, I would say that this hotel's greatest asset is quiet - I heard absolutely nothing from any quarter at any time of the day.","en"
"888",4,"It's about 5 mins walk to Holborn or Covent Garden tube stops and 4-5 mins walk from the heart of Theatreland. A cracking location that feels safe and secure.

"892",4,"In big cities like London and Paris, where hotels are expensive, if you're unfamiliar with the areas, one may end up in an area where it is not safe for a woman to be out alone at night looking for a place to have dinner. This hotel is in quite a posh neighborhood of London, yet walking distance to places with good selection of food and some shopping. The area is also near Underground stations. The room was really quite small but very well appointed and I slept very well. I would go back to this place and am impressed with the Shaftesbury chain overall.","en"

"894",2,"My Trade Association booked me in here as it was just alone from where I had a meeting first thing the following morning. First they had cocked up the prepayment of the booking but were more interested in taking a card for 'extras'. All I wanted was a bed for the night, but I got woken at 3am by the delivery lorries for Victoria Station which went on until 7am. Not even a pair of ear plugs in the room - that I found. Check out was understaffed and I ran out of time for any complaint to be registered. I didn't even want to stay for breakfast and rather went around the corner to a very nice Café. The rate was not the best over £200 - just stayed in better.","en"
"895",4,"The Savoy is one of the half dozen or so ""grande dame"" hotels in London with an illustrious history and so I was looking forward to my three night stay here. It is an impressive arto deco building, with a (fairly) recently refurbished interior of gleaming marble and polished wood. Rather than the usual counter check-in, you are taken to an elegant salon for what seems like a personal greeting to the hotel which is lovely. I had booked a standard ""superior queen"" room, which was quite small, but very well furnished with a great bathroom and plenty of wardrobe space. We also had a good side view of the Thames. Maid service was perfect with our room being tidied and towels replaced every time we left. We tried both of the bars and had tea in the Thames Foyer. As might be expected, service was excellent, and it was particularly good that the staff remembered our names when we returned. Doormen were also very helpful and friendly. The pool is quite shallow, but a decent size and the facility is airy and very elegant. Sauna and steam rooms are small, but as there was no one else using them when we visited that was not a problem for us. We ate at the Savoy Grill one evening, which was very good and I have left a separate review for this restauarant. The hotel charges for wifi, which was a bit irritating given the premium charge for the room. Overall, a great experience in a historic hotel. It's quite expensive for the size of room you get, but the location and service mostly make up for that,","en"
"896",4,"I stayed at the President Hotel on a 2 night London break with my Mum. The room was very nice and clean and the windows were open to let the fresh air in when we arrived. The bathroom was good with very hot water and both the bath and shower worked well. The weather was very warm and we didn't need the duvets on the beds but we slept well. The buffet evening meal was included on the first night and it was a nice surprise to see that this included salmon. Our starters of prawn cocktail and a trip to the salad bar were very good. Our deserts of chocolate gateaux and bannofee pie were excellent. A buffet breakfast is included and although the quality of the bread and other items were not of the best quality it was a decent breakfast. Some of the hotel areas are a little tired but the bar area is very pleasant and has wifi access although this was only available for half an hour in the bedroom. The hotel is a 2 minute walk to the tube station and a 10 minute walk to Euston. In fact it is in a great location for walking to Oxford Street and Covent Garden and a short walk to the British Museum. I was pleasantly surprised with this hotel and would not hesitate to return.","en"

The lounge, bar and reception area has awesome designer sofas to relax in with the papers, after eating too much at the amazing breakfast buffet (the food oh the food, fresh and delicious we ate way more than we usually do). It really feels much more welcoming and homely than a hotel, its cool laid back vibe with groovy artwork and books means you can hang out anytime of day. The beds are really comfy and the tablet controls are a brilliant touch, especially if you are surprising a techy/gadget lover, like I was! You must stay here!!","en"

It has great rooms, a delightful tiny bar, and lovely patio, discreet staff, good restaurant, and in smack in the middle of the energy that is Soho. Within walking distance of a ton of restaurants and parks and museums etc. Bit pricey but look around on travel sites that often get much lower rates. Take decent clothes. This is a fine hotel not a hostel! Enjoy. The ""when did you travel"" question is moot because we went there so often. So I just picked a date out of my hat.","en"
"902",4,"I have recently stopped here twice in a month, first time in a twin room and the second in a double room. The double room was tiny but nicely decorated and in in good condition, the twin was bigger. The only complaint i would have is the TV's have not been set up correctly and you get weird aspect proportions The position next to Euston Station is tucked away but it is in a relatively quiet spot. The food and service in Brasserie43 is excellent and the staff are very pleasant and friendly especially Weronike, who remembered me and was very helpful and charming. It is not right in the heart of the action and probably from the size of the the rooms does not justify its 4 star status, but this is London I guess. I would definitely stop here again.","en"
"903",4,"I was debating rating this a 3 over a 4. It is probably more of a 3.5. I am not very difficult to please, as long as I get a clean, modern room at a decent price. This is what we got. We had a quad room which was nice. It consisted of one queen bed, and two small beds. Not quite a North American twin, but good enough for my 12 year old. My only complaint would be that the air conditioner did not seem to work. This did not bother us the first two days since it was cooler, but on the third day the weather heated up and the AC would have been nice. My husband went to the front desk, but they did not seem too bothered by it. I believe they half heartedly offered a change of room, but by then it would have been horrible to have to change rooms. One of my daughters complained that her bed was really hard (which it was). One of the beds was fine, but the other seemed to be rock hard. All in all, this hotel has a great location. It was our first time in London, and being able to stay close to such a central tube / rail station was key. Kings Cross / St. Pancras seems to connect you to pretty much anywhere. Even with the AC hickup I would definitely recommend this hotel. I would definitely stay here again.","en"
"904",4,"I stayed here for 6 nights while on business and I disagree with the other comments saying this is not a 5-star hotel; it certainly is by any standard. The room was great - what you'd expect from a 5-star hotel, but it was the extras that made the place excellent. First, you can't beat the location just one block from St. Paul's. Second, the gym (""Ajala"") was amazing - it was a full-sized gym with rooms for spinning and yoga classes, free weights, cardio, a full length pool, hot tub, sauna, steam room. Third, the breakfast included in my rate was truly wonderful - every sort of breakfast food imaginable (my favorite were the sauteed mushrooms): eggs made to order, all kinds of meats (I did not eat being a vegetarian), breads and pastries, several kinds of juices, fruits, yogurts, and your own pot of coffee or tea...and it was all you can eat. The staff were delightful, accommodating (I asked for extra coffee in my room and it was promptly provided, a lot of it), and friendly. Free wi-fi, to boot. Great place to stay. The only thing that could have been better were the pillows - flat, not fluffy, but there were four of them for my king-sized bed.","en"

"906",5,"Travelled with spouse and two small children (ages 3 and 1) in September 2009. Booked two rooms and they made sure they were adjoining. Rooms were HUGE, which was great with the kids and all of their stuff. (And unexpected for Europe and London)They supplied a very nice crib for the baby and the beds were very comfortable. White marble bathrooms were very nice and toiletries were great. The Winter Garden was divine and despite being elegant and upscale they always had crayons and activity books for the kids and great kids meals. Concierge was exceptional and helped us with everything from local attractions/kid friendly restaurants to our trans-Atlantic flights. (They helped us with our seating and check-in.) Not to mention the proximity to the Tube (it's right across the street!!) It was so great with kids to be able to just hop right across the street to ride into London and all of the attractions. If all this wasn't enough, Regent's Park is a 5 minute walk, where you can feed the swans and ducks and take a boat ride!! We were having so much fun we didn't even get a chance to visit the incredible indoor swimming pool, but we have to save something for next time!!!!","en"

Upon arriving at the hotel, the entrance to which is up a short flight of steps, I found myself opening an unusually heavy door by myself with one hand while dragging my suitcase up the steps in the other. Two hotel staff were CHATTING, as you do, as I struggled to get into the building. I made it quite obvious that I was in need of a little help but alas the two gentleman's conversation must have been terribly important as when I finally made it to the check in counter, I had to wait for them to finish. Not a good start. The room itself was nice and spacious, however. For some reason the bed was unnecessarily high above the ground. Fridge was stocked with free food, which is always appreciated. It was well heated and clean. Other than the staff, it was a nice stay.","en"

We were very pleased with the comfort of the room - we only opted for the most basic room, but the bed was larger than a standard double, comfortable and the room had all we need - including 'proper' coffee bags rather than instant, which was a much appreciated touch. Great rainmaker shower too. We had asked for a quiet room as one of us is a light sleeper, and when we arrived back around midnight the bar and restaurant area were very lively and loud, so we were apprehensive, but we didn't have any disturbance at all from our room on the 6th floor at the back. Very grateful! Also had a lovely breakfast in the restaurant, and after the checkout (check in and our times were much more civilised than average too) the staff were willing to store our luggage so we didn't have to drag it around town with us.

"920",4,"Just returned from a 2 night match day package at this group of hotels. We were in the millennium and lucky to be upgraded to a suite with club access. The check in and collecting of tickets was quick and efficient and the room on the 6th floor was tastefully decorated and well presented. We had time to have a quick drink then made our way to our seats which were on the 18 yard line and we had a great view and enjoyed the match and the whole experience. Our first night meal was in the Copthorne Hotel as part of the package and this was very nice, good choice and the staff were excellent. Slept well and went across to the Copthorne again for breakfast which for a buffet was good loads of choice. The next day we spent our time visiting some of the sights and fighting with the crowds in Harrods which was not so much fun. That night we ate at Babylon in Knightsbridge I will review that separately. After another excellent nights sleep breakfast again was good and checked out without any problems. All in all an excellent couple of days and would do it again.","en"
"921",5,"Fantastic food, brilliant location - easy to find. Great view of The Shard. Despite being a Central London hotel where I believed it to be busy and noisy at night, we had a front room on the first floor (115), and it was fabulous - very quiet. Room facilities: TV, hairdryer, WiFi, tea and coffee, mini bar, comfortable beds, extra pillows in wardrobe, soft towels, room service, telephone. We had trouble getting our TV to work when we arrived so we phoned down to reception. Service was fast and the guy seemed interested in his job. Reception staff were great; Eleanor in particular, got us our room faster than planned. Again, all staff seemed as if they wanted to be there. Breakfast was splendid. Plenty of choice, hot and very delicious. Food and drink in quarter bar was delicious and reasonably priced for a city centre, staff were also helpful with a smile. We were leaving the hotel pretty early (5.30) for an awards ceremony at Westminster so we decided on a good lunch. We were not disappointed. Brilliant steak! When we got ready to go out, we went to the bar for a drink and a chat where we met fellow travellers for the ceremony. The atmosphere was electric and buzzing. We will be back! Thanks for a fab experience!","en"

"923",5,"Ive stayed in a premier inn before and you couldnt swing a cat, shower door did not shut properly and left a sodden bathroom floor. I felt decidely cheap. This hotel however, was completely different, hence my surprise. The added benefit of a last minute offer of rooms for £50 helped even more. The only thing i could see as a potential problem is the location, its a bit of a trek from the London bridge (not much bit wit bags and heels...) Its newly re-furbished and feels it, bedroom lovely, spacious, bed lovely, pillows divine. Check in swift and all electronic, however, staff on had to help quickly and efficiently if you prefer humans. Bar prices reasonable. Heated towel rail made my towel all lovely and toasty after a shower - its the little things. Good quality power shower too Breakfast staff - happy, helpful and conversational - seemed to like their jobs - who knows, maybe they were new and novelty will wear off All in all have to say - great stay","en"
"924",5,"Can't fault anything about this hotel. Pure luxury, great service, location etc. We had one of the 'standard' rooms which was more than sufficient for a weekend visit and would definitely do the same again next time we visit London.","en"
"925",5,"We stay at this hotel reasonably regularly when visiting London. It's consistently offers good value accommodation in an excellent location. Although this is a tourist hotel with quite a high turnover of staff they are always attentive and good-natured. The rooms are exactly as described and everything works as expected. On our last trip a breakfast waiter actually chased me down the street with my wallet which I had left on the table - great!","en"
"926",4,"Nice little hotel near Paddington, convenient location. I stayed in several hotels in this area, this one is on a better side. Rooms are clean and relatively nice decorated, although my room was very small. Bathroom is also small and basic, air-condition old and noisy. Free WiFi, minibar with soft drinks, iron, safe-box, gym in basement are available. I was pleased by everything except size of the room and noise outside at night. Will stay again if I see rooms on sale","en"
"927",3,"We arrived late on a Friday to a warm welcome from the man behind the desk. We picked this hotel as we had an early train from St Pancras and wanted to be as near as possible. It was easy to find and was a 2 minute walk from St Pancras. We stayed in room number 1 which had a double and a single bed, telly, wardrobe and adjoining bathroom. The room was very basic. The shower was the main let down in that it just had no power. Cheap hotel, it met our needs and is in a great location if getting the Eurostar. If you're arriving late at night and leaving early in the morning then I would recommend this hotel.","en"
"928",3,"This place served as an excellent hub for our trip to London. It's doesn't have stunning views or big rooms but if that's what you're after then you seriously need to get out more, London has much more to offer then the inside of a hotel room. Room was clean and fresh with huge TV, super comfy beds, clever storage for everything the wife insisted on bringing, air conditioning was amazing on such a warm weekend and at night/morning the rooms were pitch black for a great sleep. Premier Inn don't offer their ""Good Night Guarantee"" for their Hubs but they easily could. Staff was very very helpful and always polite. Deli bar was reasonable prices for the City and free tea and coffee 24 hours a day was a God send after a night on the town. For what it is, a place to sleep and wash for either business or a night out, it's superb.","en"
"929",4,"Good location, clean tidy room. Location very close to tube station and bus routes. Plenty of restaurants nearby. Only downside was I didn't like the sausages at breakfast. Ideal location for family or person on business.","en"
"930",2,"The rooms are nothing like the pictures, its a rather big hotel and i think the pictures relate to a small amount of rooms that have been done, the hotel is a mess from the outside it looks ok, the room was basic which is fine but there was wholes in the light shades, the chair in the room was horrific clearly there has been more then one accident on it the stains were vile. The shower worked but the head was so clogged up on you turned it on it just shot out in all directions, the shower curtain was threaded on to the washing line as the rail was broken off. the breakfast as cold toast or cereal. The maid had a tesco trolley for a cart? For two days we managed but if was for any more i would have been off and out for sure!!","en"
"931",3,"I booked RCA through Hotel.net, I was looking for a place near the US Embassy as I had to go there for a visa. I arrived earlier than expected but I was invited to wait in the lounge which was very comfortable. My room was on the 3rd floor and I was very surprised, very clean and pleasant. Lovely fully equipped kitchenette and bathroom, although small ,was very nice. Bedroom was lovely.Staff were friendly and helpful.Lovely location and the embassy was about a 20-25 minute walk. Would defitnely stay here again.","en"
"932",5,"Any staff member that we engaged was polite and efficent. The problem is that they don't seem to have people available to answer the phone when you call from outside of the hotel and no one monitors or answers the emails. I understand that the desk can get busy especially during check in and check out times, but in this case the time of day doesn't make a difference. Being able to reach someone on site when planning and during our stay would have been helpful. Being a loyal fan to the Hilton brand, I will stay at a different property if we make it back to London.","en"
"933",4,"I stayed at this hotel for three nights. The service is excellent. The concierge helped me with a lot of information and arrangements. Although my room was extremely small, if you're in London, the last place you want to stay is in your room. The hotel has been completely renovated, so the decor is contemporary and with great style. I got the internet free and breakfast package. The breakfast buffet is a little poor, but I believe this is the case in most hotels I've stayed in Europe. It would be great if the hotel had a spa where one can relax after much walking and sightseeing. The most memorable thing about this hotel is its staff.","en"
"934",5,"Just stayed at the Melia for the 4th time it is in a great location for Euston train station and only a fifteen minute walk to oxford street.

"935",5,"Stayed on a Friday night. Really cool bar with DJ, great restaurant (quite loud) if you want to eat and super comfortable room with lots of little luxuries. Fresh milk, bottles of water, deluge shower head and free toiletries. The breakfast bag's granola is delicious. Well worth a visit!","en"
"936",5,"Thinking we were booking a room at a Holiday Inn, we were pleasantly surprised to find that 5 months later the hotel had been remodeled and become a Crowne Plaza. We chose the hotel partly for its location close to the Gloucester Rd. Tube station which turned out to be ironic as there was a two day tube strike. No problem as we were able to walk to museums, stores, and to Hyde Park within 5 minutes. The rooms were spacious, the staff courteous and very helpful, even with technology in helping me with my new iPhone. Our room was at the back of the hotel - facing the garden and a definite plus that we asked for as the front of the hotel is on a busy street. The rooms were spotless and the bathroom ample with nice toiletries and good towels. Once the tube strike was over we were able to use the underground quite easily to reach other areas of London and were quite content to get back to our quiet room in the middle of a noisy city.","en"
"937",3,"A convenient location, 5 minute walk from russell sq tube, lots of convenience stores and eateries near by. The Hotel is easy to check in and out with no hassles , hotel decor a bit out dated but to be expected from large old hotels , quiet at night if you get a back room busy road to right of the hotel. Not bad value for money considering London is a top value capital city for tourism and business ,overall enjoyed my time here.","en"
"938",4,"Stayed here a couple of times when visiting London. Always pay for the early check in which I think is a little expensive but usefu. However, on our last visit the room wasn't ready and had to wait 30 minutes which isn't long but when you've paid extra to have the room ready on arrival i was a bit put out. Rooms are very clean and have tea and coffee facilities, also useful was the ironing rooms, irons and boards set up so no having to wear crumpled clothes when out in be evening. Not the cheapest place to stay but only 2 minutes walk from and to the train station/underground.","en"
"939",5,"We stayed 20th & 21st March in a standard double room, slightly cramped, but for the special offer price of £80.00 in central London, could not grumble. The bed and bathroom were very clean. The staff were very professional and friendly. The hotel is very close to Euston Station, Regents Park, Grt Portland & Warren Street Tubes all just a few minutes walk. A stroll around Regents Park on a sunny Sunday morning in early Spring was delightful. If you are feeling energetic you can walk to Oxford Street, Marylebone High Street in about 20/30 minutes and you are at the whole ""hub of central london"". I would thoroughly recommend a privately owned Italian restaurant within 5 minutes walk from the hotel which we came across close to Great Portland Street (see their website www.conchigliarestaurant.com). Their Sunday 3 course meal for approx. £15.00 is a steal! The food was excellent and the staff delightful. Must be visited. I would definately stay at this hotel again and recommend it to anyone.","en"
"940",4,"Great location, walking distance to Oxford Street, Bus Tours, Shopping and Restaurants. With HHonors, you get free WiFi, and also opted for the breakfast, which was pretty filling. Rooms are a bit small (compared to the USA), same for bathrooms, but the staff works really hard to make sure your stay is memorable.","en"
"941",3,"Booked this hotel at short notice as it is oideally located close to the train station. Compact sized bedrooms (as one would expect in central London hotels) with hygienic beds and bathrooms. Room service available. Staff are friendly and checking in was a breeze. I was allocated to a room on the first floor. Despite my initial concerns around the street noise, the room was surprisingly quiet. A few shortcomings on this hotel - firstly, there was no concierge. In the rooms, would've liked safes to leave my valuable belongings. The bathroom was compact but the towels looked to be a bit aged. During my recent visits, I also encountered WiFi connectivity issues with their premium service (‘ultimate’ WiFi) which can be frustrating for remote workers. Overall, it's not a bad choice for travellers seeking a 'no frills' accommodation. However, with plenty of competitors located within close proximity, I would probably think twice about revisiting.","en"
"942",1,"I travel every week for work and only ended up in the IBIS as all my regular hotels were booked up. I won't be coming back - Avoid please. Hotels should get no extra credit for cleanliness - that should be a given. First of all it wasn't cheap. It was an average price for a London hotel so no marks for budget. This is the first hotel/guesthouse I have ever stayed in worldwide that does not do room service???? After a long day of work with much more to do I asked for room service - Not done. After much negociation I order at the bar and someone grudgeingly brings it to my room but I am left in no doubt this is a big favour and won't happen a second time. I order a glass of wine (malbec) (London Prices) undrinkable and ends up in the sink. How hard is it to purchase drinkable wine. To get premium internet access you need an access code for the Internet. Another 5 minutes of arguing on the phone why I don't need to go to reception to pick up the code but it can be read over the phone. Food was tolerable.. If I had not work to do I would have ate out -cheaper and tastier. overall compared to the business orientated hotels I stay in there is not redeeming feature wiht IBIS Blackfriars. You can do a lot better elsewhere.","en"
"943",1,"shocking experience!!! when we arrive it all seemed fine staff were ok a bit unenthusiastic but ok showed us to our room which we thought would be nice as they has put on the description fully refurbished we entered the room which was a lot smaller than the rooms advertised on the website so small that the dressing table under the mirror left me little space to get around it and the bed I noticed a vile looking stain on the head board god knows what it was and some hairs in the bed I though I would check the bedding no quilt just a sheet and a Vile looking wool blank I lifted to see if the mattress that has no protector only to see more hairs under the mattress and a sheet just covering the mattress the mattress was so badly stained I feel it should no longer be used and replaced if not a protector to be placed on it we went to used the dresser drawer but didn't as the door was falling of the air com in the room gurgled and bused every 30mins or so keeping me away as the hotel was way to hot so needed to be on we noticed a really bad smell and though it might of just been the toilet had been previously used and still some smell had been there so we went out for the rest of the day returning in the evening to get ready the smell was still there and it has got much worse so I tried closing he bathroom door which was a struggle as the door didn't close properly without yank it shut and when we had returned the bedroom area didn't smell until we opened the bathroom door again and it was awful like a baked up drain the bathroom looked like t had partly done up but he shower and big scrapes in it and still hair from the previous say in the shower the shower do was almost impossible to slide across so I gave up until my partner helped push it shut from the outside and helped me open it again I wanted to leave the hotel at once but due to Chelsea flower show the whole of London was either double price or fully booked I have attached some photos and as you can see on the website my room looks nothing like the rooms showed hence my disappointment!! NOTE TO PEOPLE AVOID AT ALL COSTS I emailed them to complain and got offered a 25% reduction which is a joke I want a full refund but am being ignored","en"

"946",4,"This was my second stay at Cavendish London, This time I came with my daughter, We really enjoyed are stay here. The location is ideal for visiting theatres and shopping. The staff were lovely and very helpful. The breakfast is probably the best I have had in any London hotel. The quality and selection is amazing. We had 2 evening meals in the restaurant and they were excellent. We travelled by train to Kings Cross station and we caught the 91 bus and then walked to the hotel. On the return we went to Green Park tube station which has a lift so it made it quite easy with our luggage. Hopefully I will return next year with my son.","en"
"947",3,"I don't feel like saying anything bad about this hotel. It's an average hotel, clean room, with everything you may need (tv, hair-dryer, kettle, soaps); breakfast is fine, it could be better, but it could definitely be worse. The staff is kind and the position is very good; 5 minutes from Victoria coach station, train station and metro. You could even walk to Oxford street (I personally did it, and it was a very pleasant walk). The price is medium-low (for London standards), so I believe it's fine for a few days stay. I would probably stay there again.","en"
"948",4,"I stayed here last year whilst it was undergoing sone refurb and was awoken early by builders. The manger and his team reacted very well to the issues I had and I returned recently. It was excellent. Great room (601) and lovely service. Definitely recommend .","en"
"949",3,"Stayed for two nights recently while in London on Business. Choose the hotel for it location and had not stayed there before. Internet booking was simple and the staff were helpfull on arrival the hotel was clean and tidy and the Aston bar is nice and busy in the evenings. The rook (5th floor) was small but clean and comforable with flat screen TV. coffee and tea facilaties a safe and a fridge to store food and drink if you wish. The bathroom had a shower/bath and was clean and adequet - it was a twin and may have been a bit cramped for two people. It had windows onto the central ""well"" and so was very quiet Breakfast was cooked buffet syle and very nice the staff were polite and on the ball. I didnt use the reseraunt for dinners as there are so many local resaraunts to choose from - lebanese one night Greek the next! Checkout was straight forward. I will use this place again most deffinately.","en"
"950",4,"The hotel itself was of high quality and good value for money in my opinion. The main problem with the room was non existent sound proofing of the front door. The room itself was well sound proofed, but we spent most of the night listening to heels walking up and down outside our room on the way to the ice machine. Thank goodness for ear plugs! We had a lovely express breakfast to take with us, including egg and bacon sandwiches, smoked salmon and cream cheese muffins, pastries, fruit, yoghurt and hot drinks. We were unsure whether we would get anything at all the night before as the staff were a little vague, like they were all on their first shift, perfectly friendly if a little unsure. We asked for more milk for our room and they bought us a glass of milk. In general good, but areas to improve on.","en"
"951",4,"We stayed 8 nights at the Rubens. I had stayed at the sister hotel Montague on the Gardens a couple of years ago and had a great stay there. Although the Rubens has a good location, helpful front desk staff, and a nice English feel, it could have been better. The room was tired, crowded and overdecorated (the garish mirror next to the TV on the wall next to the Picasso print was exhausting just to look at!). The breakfast was the same every morning (this may be true at all Red Carnation hotels but it got old after 8 days) -- it would have been nice if there had been a tiny bit of variety, like different fruit for the yogurt, or different pastry, and it took too long for the staff to bring coffee, which was good but often not hot. Also, the concierge staff was uneven -- I had read of a great Lebanese restaurant (Cafe Nouf) a stone's throw from the hotel on Trip Advisor and the concierge never heard of it. All in all, a good hotel, at a good price, but minor tweaks like updating the room decor and improving both food and service at breakfast, would make it much much better.","en"
"952",3,"Given my previous review, I returned with my wife to see if it could be as good second time around. It was BETTER. If you are looking for somewhere special to stay in London with a wow factor, this is definitely worth considering. Location: 5 minute walk from the nearest tube and close to Westminster Abbey and the River Thames. Hotel: full of character as you walk down the tree lined drive to the front entrance. The reception area is pure class on the back of a significant refurb. The reception team clearly enjoy their job and once again provide a warm and sincere welcome. The room: once again as a Marriott gold member, we were lucky enough to enjoy a room upgrade. The junior suite was compact and perfect with attention to detail including the nespresso machine, plug sockets catering for European and American guests as well as fluffy large bathrobes! Restaurant: the Caxton grill is a MUST. Elis and his team did an excellent job again. Quality food, Quality service and a superb atmosphere. My wife and I are now both BIG fans of St.Ermins and the Caxton Grill. It gets a 12/10...top marks and we will be back.","en"

"961",4,"My friend and I checked in at 2pm we used the express check in which saved time. Our twin room was very clean no real view to speak of but we paid £75 each each for a 2 night stay really cheap for London prices. The hotel is close to tower bridge and there are some trendy shops, bars and restaurants in the local vicinity good if you don't want to go on the tube too often. The staff in the hotel were polite and friendly and reminded us of premier inn's good night policy. We ate in the hotel restaurant on the first night the service was excellent and very quick which was important as we had tickets for ""wicked"" and needed to leave sharpish. We had 2 courses and a drink for about £15 per head they offered large portions and good quality ingredients. Whilst we were out on the 2nd day we had fresh towels and bedding in our room and replacement teas and coffees which you don't always get for 2 nights. Overall a great little hotel slightly out of the way from the hustle and bustle of Leicester square and picardilly but still close enough to enjoy a great fun filled weekend in the capital! We will stay again.","en"
"962",2,"4* hotels in London always seem to charge a lot but fall short on expectations. The room I had was very small and the bed was supposed to be a double but seemed more like 1.5 singles. There was no view as the window was frosted glass. After asking for a quiet room I could hear the music from an event happening at the hotel until 1 am. Whilst the room was modern and had internet access, access was slow and certainly not value for money. The desk was barely big enough for my small laptop. Service in the bar was slow however when a manager got involved over a problem with food arriving cold the matter was dealt with quickly and efficiently. Having stayed here before it seems that there is always a queue for Breakfast.","en"
"963",4,"This hotel is quite busy with tourists, and parking is very limited, however there is always staff on the reception desk and at the door with helpful advice. The nearest tube is Gloucester Road which has the Piccadilly, district and circle line, which is fantastic for sightseeing and especially for Heathrow as you do not need to change as it is on the Piccadilly line and saves you a $130+ taxi fare. Easy to walk to Museum of Natural History, science museum or kensington high street or hyde park. London is fantastic to walk around you see so much history on every corner. There are plenty of bars and cafes in easy walking distance and a drycleaners, plenty of taxis and supermarket if you prefer to do a cheaper option of making your own sandwiches all within very easy walking distance. Rooms in my opinion are small and ours smelt of smoke although it was supposed to be non smoking. But that was once and we have stayed several times and other time fine. they do get booked up and breakfast time is busy or bit of a wait if checking in or out and particular times of the day. worth checking out their prices on lastminute websites such as rates to go etc. we often stay here because of convenience to getting around London.","en"
"964",5,"We stayed for one night on a recent business/leisure trip and were delighted by the experience. From the first 'hello', to being waved off by the doorman, we were made to feel incredibly welcome and as though we were the most special people in the world. Given that we ‘only’ had a standard room, there was not the slightest sense that we were less important than someone staying in one of the more expensive rooms. That is to be applauded by the staff and management alike. What made that even more extraordinary was that the staff achieved this without being overly formal or pompous as can be the case with five star hotels. We also enjoyed a meal at Outlaws restaurant and the food, wine, service and surroundings are totally deserving of their Michelin Star. Overall, a great experience and one I hope to repeat before too long!","en"

"968",5,"This hotel is located between Lancaster gate and Paddington station. Saying that I mean that you have less than 10min walk to the tube/buss trains. That meaning your connection to whole city is within your reach in less then 25min. The rooms are indeed thiny but we were able to be two grown adults with two large bags and handluggage and still have room to move around freely. Years with Tetris practice might have helped out. Service was really great! They were really polite welcoming and helpful at any time of the day and took their job very seriously. Night shift helped us with food and were helpful beyond the point of him actually doing his job. I ordered some items online to the hotel beforehand and all was perfectly taken care off and even helped to my room with it! Tea and coffee at the room facilities Clean and fresh toilet without any remarks. Water pressure in London sucks which was the case here as well but thats a common issue throughout the city(maybe even UK from our experience) Did not try the breakfast to review here. Area is nice, quite and clearly upper/middle-class. we were afraid the pub across the street would make a lot of noise at Saturday night but it closed early and was quite! Do not try the Italian restaurant up the street. Bad case of food poisoning there... Food at the pub across the street was ok nothing super gourmet but quite good. As good as far pub food is in London. Would recommend this hotel for about who ever. I can see how it may be a issue to be a family with two rooms that are this size but it's still a matter of adjusting.","en"

"970",5,"One nights stay as it was recommended by a friend. As soon as we walked into the lobby we where made to feel welcome, the décor was perfect and very cool, the staff where extremely helpful and to be honest I will be recommending and staying in this hotel again. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED","en"
"971",4,"The location of the hotel is excellent. There were several bus stations near to the hotel. The downtown was very close to it. The hotel was clean, the staff was very kind. The room was beautiful but I found it too small. Generally we enjoyed our stay very much.","en"
"972",1,"Stayed in this ""hotel"" if that's what you can even call it for one night - thank god! The whole hotel is covered in stains, on the walls and carpets in the corridors as well as the rooms. We stayed in a ground floor room which had a horrible smell when walking in, the carpets and walls were stained so badly. The curtains were old and again you guessed it...covered in stains! This was meant to be a double room but was tiny. The double bed was in fact to singles pushed together. The bottom sheet on the bed you could see the mattress through it. The walls had two big white square marks on them where pictures had been taken down. The skirtings were hanging off. The bathroom was a bit more modern than the room, again though it was tiny and the toilet flusher did not work!! The shower temperature did whatever it wanted, one minute scalding you the next it was freezing. The shower curtain was handing off and suffocating me having a shower! I actually felt more dirty after my shower! In the morning we went down for breakfast on the lower ground floor. We walked into an awkward layout which was basically a kitchen. Breakfast was coffee, tea or orange juice with a bag of bread for toast! They also charge £5 per room for leaving your bags after check out. They are not kept in a secure area they are in full view of people. And to my horror we had to pay £90 for the room only to learn there was a premier inn nearby for £86! Never again! Pics attached!!","en"
"973",2,"I stayed in this room for one night. The girl at the check in was really friendly, but maybe a little bit too much. This hotel feel more like an guest house, and I personally more prefer the ""hotel vibes and service"". They charged me 50 Pounds for the deposit. The room was that swedish minimalistic style with some dadaïste collage on the wall, which gives me nightmare during the night, I do not like the fact that people face and eyes look at me... But everything else was great, maybe the bed a little bit too low. I was surprised that there is no free tea and coffee with the electric kettle but this is my first time in London, I'm used to Asian and European hotel. At 7.30 am they call me to ask if I'm always taking a big English breakfast with coffee and orange juice that was planned for 9am... I never asked for that... I tell the guy at the phone to cancel that, he was talking so weird and low that I nearly understand nothing, and he knew that my first language wasn't English. The check out was fast, but I really don't like the vibes and hotel's style. But this is definitely a personal taste. I don't blame the hotel for that. I supposed that I prefer a more traditional and luxurious hotel. If you like to make friend and talk about art this is clearly a place for you.","en"
"974",5,"But they do make this very clear on the website! This was our second stay here - this time with our daughters who were equally enthused. We don't mind the rooms. They are small but have great facilities. The great features here are location and service. The staff are very friendly and helpful and the location must be one of the best in London. Looking forward to the next time.","en"
"975",4,"The wedding venue was very good and the event manager (not the hotel staff/management) was superb for the wedding ceremony in the Conservatory. However, I had a suite in the hotel and the service I received was totally shambolic. I had to wait over 30 minutes to get a porter to carry my luggage. The room lights went out and it was pitch black for nearly 40 minutes while the engineers slowly attempted to fix the situation at a critical point so that our wedding ceremony was delayed because we couldn't get changed. As a result of the electrics issue the door to our adjoining room was locked shut so that we had no access to this room and the items in there, despite the electrics being repaired. The hotel management didn't send anyone up to fix this problem until we decided to check out 10 hours early. We asked for a porter to take a few small items from our suite to the wedding venue downstairs and the concierge started arguing with us and slammed the phone down. In the end we checked out at 2am because we were sick and tired of the shambolic service at the hotel. The staff are very unhelpful, rude and can't speak English properly. I wouldn't let my dog stay here. Total waste of money, ruined my night, they didn't offer an apology or a discount. Don't stay in Fawlty Towers - better service in a card board box on the road outside. Pathetic.","en"
"976",5,"We couldn't have chosen a great location to stay. The hotel is centrally located, walking distance from Buckingham palace, Westminster Abbey, Big Ben and St James Park. Also, it's very close to the Underground station (St. James Park). Great breakfast at Caxton Grill. The high tea experience is also a big plus.","en"
"977",5,"And this weekend I finally managed it. The hotel is central to everything and the staff are some of the best I have experienced. The first thing the receptionist said was that our room had a bad view, for which she appoligised and gave us free breakfasts for our stay, which was excellent. The room itself was well maintained and it had a wet room. I have nothing but praise for the hotel and staff. Okay the bar drinks were a little expensive, but it's London and a 5 star hotel. Some reviewers have noted the poor rooms, ours was excellent, they must be doing a refit or something. All I can say is that I would recommend it to everyone","en"
"978",4,"Very nice, clean hotel room. A little too warm for our liking and no way to regulate the heat. Exceptional continental breakfast each morning. Long taxi ride to downtown sites and to the theater district. Made longer by heavy traffic. I guess this drawback made this hotel more affordable. Very nice staff.","en"
"979",3,"I have stayed at several hotels throughout London but prefer this location. It is within walking distance to many attractions and the tube station is only a couple of minutes walk away. The rooms are a little small but did not mind this because of the excellent location. The staff were all pleasant and helpful however I did have trouble communicating with some of the reception staff as their English was quite poor. Apart from that the hotel was great.","en"
"980",5,"My wife and I were staying at the hotel last week for 7 nights. The moment we arrived we were treated great by the very friendly hotel staff and especially by the hotel extraordinarily manager Mr. Ahmed Salah who took care of all our needs and even provide for us affordable taxi to Heathrow Airport. The hotel is modern and the rooms are small but equipped with all necessary. The most importantly it is located at the most central of London and close to underground stations. The hotel is highly recommended and definitely affordable. No doubt we will return to stay in this hotel at the future and we also recommend visitors to London to stay in this hotel.","en"
"981",4,"Room clean and quiet and beds were really comfy. Proximity to Blackfriars station very helpful. Good access to South Bank attractions, St Pauls and Tower of London. Couple of pubs nearby as well as TescoExpress and Sainsburys. We were able to leave luggage in safe storage on last day. Would stay again.","en"
"982",4,"The hotel is perfectly located to have some shopping at Westfield Bushman's Kloof (only a few 100 meters away). As the underground station is very near (red, central line) it is even very good to explore the whole city. The staff was very friendly and (because the room wasn't ready?) we got a VIP pass for the shopping center. The room (Deluxe) was spacious with a nice seating corner and the bed was really superb!","en"
"983",5,"I stayed here on business, and this hotel did not disappoint. The room was a decent size, and very well presented, the staff were all extremely friendly and were always happy to help. The location is exceptional, shame I could not see St Pauls Cathedral outside of my window, but thats nothing. The room service has two options, food from the hotel, or a takeaway from Deliverance (The hotel has an account with them). Personally I chose Deliverance as it had a bit more choice. Personally DON'T.Just use the hotel food. But that's Deliverance's problem, not the hotel's problem. Fantastic nights sleep, comfortable bed, clean room, the list goes on and on.","en"
"984",2,"Three key issues arose when we stayed at the weekend: 1. Our room was on the 5th floor and was very cold throughout our stay. On the first night my friend and I tried to work the heating system but were shivering all night. We complained the next day and they said they would look at the problem but didnt bother to ask our room number! I quickly asked if she wanted to know what room we were in! We were instructed to get a heater from a storeroom on our floor for the second night which aleviated the issue. 2. We were awoken by the fire alarm on saturday morning at 7am and rushed out of bed to get changed and make our way downstairs. Once dressed the alarm started sounding intermitently and we were confused as to what to do. We tried ringing reception but no one answered. In the end we had to find someone who explained someone had been smoking but there was no apology etc. 3. We returned from our day out on Saturday to no running water. My friend was feeling unwell and could really of done with a glass or two of water and a functioning toilet. This was totally iunacceptable and no apology or compensation was offered. They say they have a good night service but I saw no evidence of this. Would not stay in Premier inn again due to poor customer service.","en"
"985",5,"From before we left for England to the minute we checked out; the Cranley made the experience wonderful.... The staff was more than helpful, going the extra mile to insure our happiness and comfort. The concierge took care of all of excursions with promptness and great advice. The management, having been in touch with me by email before our arrival, was waiting for us and even allowed us to choose the room we wanted since our arrival was so early in the day! From the moment of our arrival, we felt like royalty! The accommodations were lovely, nice beds, linens, beautiful furniture. Very quiet street for being in such a good location. The complimentary tea each afternoon, the champagne each evening, gave the hotel a very elegant, yet comfortable feel. Great location, very safe, and a short 5 minute walk to the Tube. I was traveling with my 18 year old daughter, and The Cranley made our trip to London fabulous. The concierge's recommendations from day trips to local excursions were invaluable. I can't wait to return to London, and the Cranley.","en"
"986",5,"This is a fantastic hotel right in the heart of London. Despite an old world exterior it is modern and very comfortable. The staff are very attentive without becoming intrusive, but nothing is too much trouble. Polite and helpful, from reception, to dinning and bar staff they all made us feel very welcome. The rooms are excellent. Plenty of room and all that you may need. Modern and a very high standard. My only small negative is that the wifi connection and speed could be better. The food is excellent and reasonably priced, whilst the bar is a little pricey. Whilst you may find cheaper, I don't think you will find better!","en"
"987",4,"Needed an overnight stay to attend a wedding. Convenient for walking to Embankment, Imperial War Museum and tube line. Rooms basic but clean and amazing value for money for central London. Booked 2 rooms for £110; unbeatable. Even had a view of the Shard. Single occupancy of the room would be OK for more than an overnight. Costa Coffee next door offered a place for breakfast. The small left luggage charge was a bonus. Great find and will encourage me to travel to London more often and stay overnight.","en"
"988",4,"The room was good (kindly upgraded on arrival to a view of the London Eye). Was well placed for the things we wanted to do. We love walking, so I highly recommend to walk rather than tube. 25 mins...and we were up in Covent Garden as an example","en"
"989",5,"Whether this is your first time in London or you are a returning traveler, The Rubens at the Palace is the place in central London to stay. Just steps away from Buckingham Palace (really!) and within walking distance of many attractions. The staff is most helpful, the bar is wonderful and they even give you a yummy breakfast.","en"
"990",4,"We stayed here from boxing day for a few nights and the hotel itself was really nice.The rooms are very small and so I would recommend upgrading to a larger room if you can. The hotel facilities, location and layout are3 great and I would recommend it for those reasons. The problems I experienced were with the lack of information the staff seemed to have and the overall customer service. Everyone I encountered was polite but just didn't seem very interested in making my stay enjoyable. We drove to the hotel and on arrival asked where we were to park, the Concierge gave us a blank look and then finally directed us to a closed car park! We had called in advance to request a twin bedded room which they said was fine but this had not been added to our reservation and there was no record of this on arrival. The lady on front desk tried to accommodate this whilst also trying to get us to upgrade and sign up for the Melia loyalty programme at the same time. Which meant check in at &pm on boxing day took around 25minutes. We agreed to the upgrade having read the trip advisor reviews which recommended this but then after 20 minutes she advised us that there were no twin bedded larger rooms available. I explained in detail that 2 seperate beds were needed as I was travelling with my Dadand eventually we checked in and had to wait a furter 10minutes for the room to be set up. No compensation was offered for this delay. When we finally made it to the room there were 2 single beds pushed firmly together with no way of separating them, we left the stuff in the room and complained on the way out for dinner. We were told that nothing could be done about this and again no compensation was offered. Some people would find this hotel a little far off the beaten track but I know london quite well and its just a 10 minute walk to oxford st and 20 minutes to the theatre district. London Zoo is right on your doorstep with this hotel and there is a tube station outside. I wouldn't choose to return due to the poor customer service but it is a great location and we may have just caught them at a bad time so you never know.","en"
"991",5,"So my introduction to the Kensington Close started on a negative, I had been booked into another hotel that was overbooked and so was moved to the Kensington close. This was our gain! Check in: this was busy but the team worked swiftly, were friendly and welcoming. Rooms: we had a twin room, this was on the small side however, it was clean, tidy and comfortable. The bed was so lovely, we both slept extremely well. Bathroom, recently renovated, lovely and clean, great showers and lovely quality towels. Bar: you rate a bar area by its staff and how it was used, the bar was packed and staff efficient and friendly, as long as you keep your feet off the coffee tables..... Breakfast: buffet style breakfast, English or continental, food hot, well cooked. So, thank you Kensington Close, great short stay and I will be back.","en"
"992",5,"Wonderful Art Deco theme. Staff excellent, helpful & exceeded my expectations. Parked my car there, no problems at all.

"994",5,"We stayed here as a family, our daughter's graduation was at the Royal Festival Hall, so location was perfect. Our room was clean, comfortable and exactly what you expect from a Premier Inn. We opted for the evening meal and breakfast deal which was very good value, everything that was served was of good standard, staff were lovely. We could leave our luggage at the hotel after check out which was a bonus. The only slight disappointment was that we left a phone charger in the room (entirely our fault) and this was not handed in by the cleaning staff, it's sad when you cannot have complete trust. However, we would recommend this hotel if you are staying in London.","en"
"995",3,"On arrival we were asked for our passports ... Luckily, as we booked this hotel to attend the US Embassy for a visa interview, we had them with us. If we hadn't, what then? Grosvenor Square is a convenient central London location for other things besides the US Embassy; as other reviewers have noted, the Tube is a seven minute walk away. There is a pub on the corner and a mini-mart across the street. Prices are what you should expect in central London (crazy!), staff are pleasant(ish), the rooms are appointed quite well and that's about it on the positive side. Things that got on my nerves, included: The bed was in one of those trendy low box things which had been helpfully painted black so that it blended into the, dark, carpet. I lost count of the number of times I bashed my shin or foot on the corner of the thing as I walked past. Eventually I draped white towels over these corners as a warning ... not terribly satisfactory, I'm sure you'll agree. The wardrobe had a light in it which came on when the door opened. Unfortunately the door didn't shut properly so this light came on throughout the night. Other reviewers have mentioned the restaurants onsite but haven't commented on the smell of food in the elevators and throughout the ground floor. Room service has a £4 cover charge and a 14.5% service charge... more expensive than the Ritz! There is a £10 charge for wifi in the room. And, to finish things off for me, as we came down the stairs, we witnessed the 'meet and greet' bloke, in the lobby, sneeze into his hand and then put his hands behind his back again. Yuk! Would I stay there again? Probably not.","en"
"996",5,"Great little hotel well worth the money. Decor a bit tired but they are starting a major revamp so ignoring the paint etc the hotel was well worth the money and would stay here again . Breakfast was a choice of continental and cooked and nothing was to much trouble","en"
"997",2,"Hotel looks dated and tired and badly in need of a good reno. Had to change rooms 3 times before I found one that the carpet did not look and smell musty. The carpet in the corridors were old and musty too. The furnishing was dated and old and corners of furniture were damaged. Overall, very depressing rooms. The staff were very accommodating though and very courteous. Location is fantastic, right next to tube entrance.","en"
"998",5,"So I went to this new build hotel with some expectation. I was not disappointed, the rooms are very well appointed, and bathrooms very smart and modern. I was impressed with the separate shower and bath, and also the Free Wi-Fi in the room. The amenities in the bathroom are by Ayala Spa - White Green Tea aroma and very nice - need a bit though to lather up. The Spa is in the basement and whilst I did not attend, it did look very smart. Only small comment was I thought that for a hotel that was only 2 months old, that the A/C in the room was rather loud. Situation wise it is very good and situated near to the DLR and Underground at Tower Hill just a 8 minute walk away. Would certainly stay here again.","en"
"999",4,"My sister and I had a great stay at this hotel recently. It is really easy to get to and very convenient for all the main sights. The beds are unbelievably comfortable and it is quiet and clean. The water pressure in the shower is really great and the breakfasts were above average. I had stayed at this hotel before and had sent friends who were equally impressed. I would definitely recommend it to anyone planning to visit central London.","en"

The location of hotel close to the DLR line is an added bonus.","en"

Very serviceminded staff! We would definitely stay here another time!","en"
"1003",5,"We stayed here to visit the O2 arena New Year's Eve. From arriving I was extremely happy with our stay. The South African concierge was just an absolute delight. We were weary from Driving and he put a smile on both our faces, he was extremely helpful and gave us a great way I get to the arena via cable car not just the tube. When we arrived in our room he rang to check of everything was ok. Then little things really do matter the most. For the price of the hotel and the fact it's in London was really worth it. The hotel room was clean tidy and everything you need for an overnight stay. The breakfast which was included on the price was also decent, good food a good choice and a good range of drinks. Tube trips into London are expensive but if you expect them to be cheap then you've clearly never been before. I have always stayed outside of London when visiting and I will definitely stay here again. They do not provide a dinner service but of your in London you really should get out and visit the wide range of restaurants they have there. Excellent place will return hopefully this year.","en"
"1004",5,"This was our second year at this hotel and although our room (14) was smaller this year it was still larger than other hotels we have stayed in in this price range and the other things we liked about this hotel were still very much there. As I said in my first review last year we have, over 35 years of living abroad and returning to the UK every year or so, tried many, many mid to lower -priced hotels (currrently less than 100 pounds a night double) in London and we have never returned to any of them except this one. Try the well known Indian restaurant ""Khans"", close to Bayswater tube station, for a good and well priced meal (20 pounds for 2 for food in our case - alcohol is not served). We walked there from the hotel (20mins). We have never encountered any security problems in this area (or any other area of London for that matter) We had a very pleasant stay for a very good price. This management has got this mix right in our opinion. Congrats again!","en"
"1005",3,"given a champagne afternoon tea as a gift for my birthday. Pleasant surroundings, although chairs too low for the table! lovely food, typical afternoon tea selection, but awful service.

"1008",3,"After flying all night to London from Atlanta, I was very happy to walk into the stylish, boutique-style City Inn Westminster. It had the feeling of a friendly neighborhood hotel. I loved the room with the large windows and the Apple iMac which doubled as the TV and a computer (with Skype to video chat with my husband). I quickly showered and went downstairs to the ""concierge"" to check out what I could do as a first time visitor to London. I inquired about a duck tour to which I was give a puzzled look and an ""I don't know what that is, you should look it up on line."" Hmmm. A concierge doesn't know that the city has a duck tour? He then brushed me off and sent me to a tour bus stop where I waited for almost an hour only to learn from a passerby that the bus wasn't coming as the street it needed to get to that stop was closed. I stayed in the hotel one week and this trend continued. The concierge seemed annoyed when you asked for help with anything. The hotel is conveniently located near several tourist attractions and the Pimlico tube station. There are a lot of fun neighborhood pubs and restaurants and even a Starbucks within a quick five minute walk. It's a nicely designed, comfortable and conveniently located hotel, but the service is lacking...","en"
"1009",4,"As a solo traveller I was apprehensive about staying alone but I had no reason to be concerned. This hotel is so close to Earls Court underground station and so easy to get to from Heathrow on the Piccadilly line. Lifts are great when lugging a suitcase. I was in Room 1 and there was a lift down to it. A smal, lift but I had read reviews so expected it to be squeezy. Breakfast was as described, simple but fine. Tinned mandarins, fresh grapefruit, other fruit in a bowl, yoghurt, bread, croissants with ham, salami and cheese as well as tea and perc coffee. Lovely breakfast room and very quiet when I ate at 7.30am. Room was great, had all amenities needed. Only downside was the person above me moving furniture or something heavy. Bed was relatively comfy but was 2 singles together so my hubby would have complained if he had been there! Friendly reception staff who answered my queries with no troubles. Lovely neighbourhood with so many restaurants, bars, cafes, supermarkets etc. got a pedicure, all my food (Marks &Spencer), SIM cards and money all within 5minute walk. Perfect spot.","en"

Starter looked like cream of mushroom soup on soggy bread, main meal was a microwave curry with rock solid naan!! Guy taking the order at bar looked like he wanted to kill him self for working there, for the price charged it was horrible. Also traffic noise when trying to sleep was the worst.

Disappointingly we didn't have time to make use of the pool and spa facilities, however this definitely would be a big bonus after exploring London all day if you are staying in the hotel longer than a night.

"1016",1,"I wasn't expecting much for the price I paid (and even less on the basis of the reviews), but nevertheless I found this hotel to be unacceptable. In fact, I ended up leaving and going to stay elsewhere. There was a pungent smell of fresh cigarette smoke throughout the hotel. The reception area was perfectly acceptable, if a little sparse, but I found the staff behind the desk to be very abrupt and they seemed not to want to interact with guests. The room itself was awful. It was tiny - the double bed almost filled the room. The wallpaper was peeling and the mattress, pillows and duvet were all covered in stains. The bathroom was filthy. I spent a bit of time in the room and, taking into account the issue with cigarette smoke, decided to leave and stay somewhere else. Avoid if at all possible.","en"
"1017",4,"We stayed at the Strand Palace for six nights on our vacation in mid-November. The hotel is in a great location just a few short blocks from Covent Garden. Easy to get to and from the airport with your luggage. This is a large, older hotel and feels somewhat impersonal. You definitely feel like a number rather than a special guest. The rooms appear to have been recently remodeled and have nice furnishings. The first night we were in a room on the second floor facing the Strand. It was a relatively large room with an updated bathroom. The problem was the noise from the construction at some adjacent buildings. The construction activity was 24/7 and did not allow for a good night sleep. Immediately the next morning we went to the front desk to request a different room. The hotel staff gave us a very difficult time in accommodating our request. We had to speak to a manager and plead for a different room. It should not have been this difficult in a hotel of this size. We finally were given a smaller room on an interior light well that was extremely quiet. The elevators were also very slow and crowded during peak hours. We did not visit the restaurant or bar because there are so many great places with street life nearby. Very easy to walk to attractions, bus stops, and Underground stations. I would highly recommend this hotel for the location and price. Unfortunately they score very low on customer service.","en"

The blind and the window were dirty and despite trying we were unable to shut the window. The blind was broken and couldn't be lifted so the room was in permanent darkness with very inefficient lighting to compensate. Consequently the noise at night made it very difficult to sleep and the lack of light was very frustrating. The bedding and bathroom were clean although the shower was very small (no good if you're on the heavy side). Staff were pleasant enough and the breakfast was adequate but very limited in choice. Next time in London it will be a Premier Inn or similar where we know we can expect a reasonable standard.","en"
"1022",5,"My wife and I stayed here as part of an overnight break including a show. Really friendly hotel in the centre of theatre land. Breakfast was excellent and I'd hoped to order a half bottle of champers to make it go with a swing as it was my wife's birthday but the Manageress apologised that they could not offer us any. However, unannounced, a few minutes later 2 glasses of Bucks Fizz were brought to our table ""on the house!"" That, Ladies & Gentlemen, is called going the extra mile - and is the first time I have ever experienced special treatment in a London hotel. Thanks to the Manageress & staff for looking after us so well. I'll definitely be going back.","en"

"1024",4,"The bad reviews of this place are exaggerated. We booked 1 night stay here without reading the reviews first. When we checked the reviews we were dreading walking into the place. However, upon arrival we were greeted by friendly reception staff who gave us directions to the room and information about the surrounding area. The room was clean, relatively modern and quiet. We stayed on a friday night. The location is brilliant for central london and is walking distance to Kings Cross Railway Station. I would certainly recommend this place if you need 1-2 nights in a central location and don't believe the really negative reviews that some people have submitted. Excellent value for money in london.","en"
"1025",4,"I wanted to spend 4 days / 3 nights in London with my daughter (9) to visit the city and make some shopping last april, but could'nt find a decent hotel at a decent price. Eventually, being french, I decided to book a room in a hotel of the french ibis chain and I do not regret it. Obviously, this is not a de luxe hotel, but it is very clean. The room is very correct, with 2 beds , a TV set, air conditioning. The bathroom is ""futurist"" with a very large shower, also very clean. People are nice and welcoming. There is a free spare room for luggage. Situated just near the Euston station, direct to Oxford street station. There is also a bus going to Oxford circus, in a few minutes. The location is perfect to visit major sites (zoo, Camden, Oxford...). The only ""bad"" point is the food. We had dinner once, but never came back afterwards. Better have your meals in a pub !","en"

"1033",3,"We stayed at this hotel for one night over the Whitsun Bank Holiday Weekend. It is quite a long ride by tube out of central London and a good 10-15mins hike from Stratford station when you have luggage and kids in tow, but the price is very competitive when compared with somewhere closer to central London. The hotel itself is very nice - all new, so very clean and welcoming. Our family room was also clean and adequately equipped, with a choice of firm/soft pillows. Reception staff were helpful and allowed us to leave our luggage there several hours before check-in. The breakfast was something else altogether. The buffet area is cramped when busy. Whilst waiting, supplies of trays, coffee cups and bread all ran out and took a long time to be replenished. There was no bacon at all and they were serving sausages instead which also ran out. I was told there would be more in 5 mins so I waited, then I was told they'd be another 5 mins. Eventually they were brought to our table, but the sausages were so awful, my dogs would've turned their noses up at them.","en"

The room was fine and very warm. The bathroom was clean and looked to have been refurbished in the not too distant past. The bed however, was extremely uncomfortable and we were both glad we were only staying one night! We were on a front facing room and the street was quite noisy into the small hours, so if you want a peaceful night, ask for a rear room! Breakfast was a bit of a free-for-all but I think we chose peak time to go down. In fairness, the staff were very efficient and had tables cleared and ready extrememly quickly. Food was basic, but good and there was plenty of it. Reception staff were friendly and welcoming and overall I would say the hotel was decent value for money.","en"

"1038",5,"Don't be fooled that the lower pricing compared to other hotels in the area is a perceived weakness of quality, comfort, or service. The Room. My room was spotlessly clean. The bed and bedding was of a similar standard seen in the larger well known hotel chains. The fixture & fittings was modern (flat screen wall mounted tv, wood flooring, power shower). Electronic controlled air conditioning. Wall Mirrors & hangers No tea / coffee making facilities, fridge, or trouser press, chair or wardrobe. ( but not required by me) Pay as you go add on's ( tv, wifi, hair dryer, towels, soap etc) to keep base price low - OR you pay an additional fee for the comfort package £8 which gets you the lot. (24hr) Cafe in reception area. Good customer service from staff. Working lift. The location/amenities 400 metres (10 min walk from/to Paddington station or tube) 200 metres (5 min walk to Edgware road tube) Tesco 24hr convenience opposite hotel. M&S food etc near Edgware tube. Restaurants fast food all around. Booking. I had problems booking direct on line and via the phone ( where you get pay as you go pricing options) I booked via hotels.com which was straight forward but included the comfort package as standard. I will definitely recommend and use this hotel again over the other well known chains if the price remains as low.","en"
"1039",4,"I stayed in The Hoxton with my boyfriend for 3 nights in Jan 2007 and was very pleased. It cost €310 for a double room for the three nights which was very very reasonable for the quality. The room was fantastic, the decor and layout were very nice. The television and wifi facilities were great, with free internet access even without a laptop. There was complimentary fresh milk and water every day which was a very nice touch to go along with tea and coffee making facilities. The bed and bed linen were extremely good quality and comfortable. The room was cleaned to perfection everyday. The bathroom was beautiful and there was a complimentary bar of Pears soap which was another nice touch. The staff were very friendly and helpful. There are very few negative things. Our room (on the third floor) faced onto Willow street with a warehouse of some sort on it. This could get quite loud with vans loading, sometimes at night. Also, there were rubbish bins back there which made it noisy sometimes also. The hotel and area in general seemed very trendy, but we did not feel that uncomfortable. The area was unusual and not particularly nice but there was a handy shop just across the street which stayed open until 11pm. All in all we had a very pleasent stay in the Hoxton.","en"

"1042",1,"Every other year I return to London and usually stay at the Royal National. This is the last time though. Each time, it is more and more expensive for a budget hotel (budget by London prices) and it never gets any better. There's still no wi-fi or USB internet connection in the rooms. There's only wi-fi in the reception area, which is constantly inundated with people because it is such a large hotel and, the internet is so bloody slow. I was in east africa recently and the wi-fi, in the places I stayed, was so much faster. As for the rooms, cramped. And I dunno how old the mattress was but it felt like I was sleeping on a soggy old victoria sponge.","en"
"1043",5,"This hotel was okay. The hotel itself was clean and nice, but we were a little disappointed with the location. On a map, it looks much closer to Paddington than it felt when we were walking. Plus, with the construction going on, if you don't know exactly where to go (which is out the back way towards the canal), it is not intuitive, and you will probably end up walking the perimeter of Paddington Station with your luggage. For us, with only one roller bag apiece, it wasn't the end of the world, but if someone had more luggage, they would need to take a taxi there. On the other hand, if you're looking to explore the Little Venice area, it's a good location. Overall, we felt it was overpriced for what it was (and where it was), and we probably wouldn't stay there again.","en"

Arrived early and asked to leave our bags, after a lot of moaning and groaning they agreed to do it. Came back after a concert we were attending to be locked out, and it took an age for anyone to let us in. Even once in it took a long time to check in, either the night man wasn't sure how to do it, or he had still not quite woken up from his sleep he was having in the office.

"1048",5,"I had a great stay at Radisson Blu Vanderbilt. The location of the hotel is perfect, the neighborhood is very nice and I felt safe there as female solo traveller. The room was small, but bigger than some of the hotels rooms I have stayed in while in London. The room had a small fridge, coffee/tea making facility, safe, TV, hairdryer, etc. all that I needed.As have have allergi towards dust I had informed the hotel about this prior to my stay. They did everything they could to to accommodate my needs and I did not have any problems staying at the hotel. The hotel room I got was very clean. The service was super. Jennifer who welcomed me at the reception did everything she could to make me feel welcome immediately. I arrived early and it was no problem for me to leave my luggage with the concierge and enjoy my time in London before I could get into my hotel room. Breakfast was very good, a huge choice. There was a small business-center with computers to use. For the price I paid ( Via Londontown.com I got a deal for £ 74 pr. night) I will have to give this hotel 5 stars. They did everything right. Yes, as you will read here on tripadvisor the lift is slow - but does it matter when service, sleeping quality and cleaning of the room is the best? Yes, interior is a bit old (bed is OK) and if some renovation (mainly bathroom, floors) was done everything would be even better....","en"

Furniture all chipped, bed uncomfortable, and the room is sparsely furnished with a horrible iron right in the middle of it hung on the wall as if it were a painting or something. The bathroom facilities are small, modest and, unfortunately, not very clean at all. The common rooms are dirty and the breakfast buffet is not very appealing. The price they charge have no relation whatsoever to the quality provided. We payed £400 per night for a family of four in what was supposed to be a suite.

"1056",4,"I recently spent 5 nights here on my first trip to London. I chose this hotel because I was using Hilton Honors points, and this hotel was 40,000 points per night (which is way fewer than other hilton properties in the area). That said, I didn't spend money for the room and I received free wifi and breakfast because of my member status. I had Room 702. Pros: - bright, clean, and modern room - comfortable bed (I tend to like them firm and found this one to be good enough) - temperature control: digital and easy to adjust - Nespresso machine for in-room coffee - mini-fridge in closet - work space: 1 built in desk with chair and one free-standing table with 2 chairs. Great for reading or drinking morning coffee. - shower: excellent water pressure with really hot water (nothing worse than a drippy, luke warm shower!). Adjustable nozzle so if you're tall (like me) you can move it upward and change the water flow. - speedy Wifi (it was free for me but cost might be a consideration) - restaurant onsite: the food isn't amazing, but it's nice that it's there if you're not feeling up to stepping out. Complimentary breakfast for certain Hilton Honors members. - service: the staff was nice (I'm low maintenance and do not ask for much help, but they did give me an extra cookie and smiled and used my name) - location: FANTASTIC! on the northwest corner of lovely Hyde Park and between 2 Underground subway stops (Notting Hill Gate and Queensway) Cons: - no tub, shower-only (I usually hate shower-only because I feel boxed in; however, it has a glass, partial wall and is very open and roomy.) - no safe (but shouldn't be a concern here) It was easy to take the Underground from the airport for only £5.70 (Piccadilly Line to Earls Court station then transfer to District Line to Notting Hill Gate). Plan at least an hour for the trip. The hotel is about a 10 min walk east from the Notting Hill Gate station. If you don't mind walking a few miles, you can get anywhere from here on foot. I spent 5 days and mostly walked or took the Underground. (But it looked fairly easy to hail cabs and Uber operates in London, also). The buses don't take cash, so look into buying one of the transportation cards if you want to ride them. I never figured that part out (but I bet it's easy). I would definitely stay here again!","en"

The foyer is informal and relaxed; very different from some other London hotels. Our room was beautifully appointed - decorated in relaxing blue grey and cream colours. Only one fault - the shower - the water pressure in the shower was awful. We reported it to the management who took our compliant on board! If this gets fixed I would give it 10/10.","en"
"1060",4,"This hotel calls itself a Boutique Hotel, but in this instance, I'm not sure what that means! It is very clean and the staff are friendly and helpful. Because the bar is open to the public, it is on Kings Cross station, it is busy and we had to wait 20 minutes for two cups of tea! Even after arrival, we had to ask if they could put some tea into the pots. We were meeting friends from the USA and requested when booking that rooms be either next to each other or opposite. I rang to check this had been done three days before arrival and was assured all was well. We arrived at 12.30 - very difficult to find reception as there is no signage and the reception desk has got to be the smallest I have ever experienced. We were informed that we did not have rooms together as our friends had requested a corner room - what difference that made still alludes me.... They arrived at 2pm and were shown their room, first disappointment ! We had paid for the most expensive rooms at this hotel and they were tiny, and the corner room which friends hoped would give them a good view of the area only had the same windows as every other room. The bathroom was small but adequate and there was no form of shelf in the shower, so all toiletries had to sit on the floor. There was a small 'inlet' of two shelves in the wall tiling but not sufficient. Nothing over the sink where it is needed. The hanging space had three hangers and is about 9 inches wide. There is another 3 hangers on a metal pole on the opposite wall and that is all. Small bedside cabinets had a draw about 9 inches square with a small shelf below. The tea/coffee making facilities in the room is an espresso machine, but they do have a larder at the end of the corridor where you can make tea and coffee - but then you have to leave your room. The feeling there is one of pretentiousness with very little comfort. This is a business mans hotel NOT one for couples or families. We had to wait until 3.30 for our room to be ready but were given a free breakfast. All in all, I'm at a loss to understand why this hotel rated 114th in the London Hotel Listing","en"
"1061",3,"Stayed here as I read good things about this hotel. It's one of many located on Sheperd's Bush Road and they all appear to be old terrace houses converted to hotels. The hotel was easy enough to find after getting out of the tube station although it was a short hike away. This could be an issue for those with suitcases but if you travel light or with a backpack, not a big issue. The room was small but adequate with a table fan and mini fridge provided. However, the bathroom was even smaller and I found this to be small to the point of being claustrophobic. Noise is an issue if you have a room facing the main road as sirens from the police cars and fire trucks are piercing. The free wifi didn't work too well so I was given the password to the wifi signal of the hotel/house next door and this worked perfectly. All in all, great for those on a budget or just on a short layover.","en"

My welcome was very warm and after reading the reviews here i asked for a good room and if i could check it out before accepting. The duty manager promised that i would be very happy with the room and if not he would gladly allow me to change to another of my liking. So accepting the challenge i was pleased to walk into a comfortable well presented room on the 2nd floor, overlooking the garden away from the street. The room was clean, the bed comfortable and the general ambiance quiet and welcoming. For the prices asked the rooms are worth it and the world travelers add a touch of character to the place. As not a big breakfast person and knowing they do not do a big breakfast i was not disappointed, reading these reviews you should get and understanding of that!! Breakfast was enough to get me going out into the day. The lift is pokey and fun but take the stairs if it's not to much hassle. The staff are great, friendly if you also make the effort to talk and smiling even when you get back in late into the morning.

The bed was amazingly comfortable and the hotel is right across from the underground which made for a very easy and an inexpensive way to get around. We used the underground to get from Healthrow and only needed to change lines once which basically required us to exit one train and take ten steps and jump onto the next line to the hotel. So many sights are within quick walking distance! We didn't eat at the hotel but were able to find many options including a Starbucks right across the street for a quick breakfast and coffee. Staff was super friendly and helpful for any questions we had and I really felt spoiled by the accommodations and staff. Would stay here again!","en"

"1071",4,"We stayed in this hotel for only one night in October 2012. Our train to London was early so we arrived at the hotel - literally 30 seconds walk from Warren Street tube station - at 10am expecting to leave our bags and check in later. The man at the check in desk could not have been more helpful, he checked our booking and checked us in immediately, we were able to check in there and then. Our room was great, on the fifth floor and on a corner. It had low ceilings but was spacious and had everything one would need for an overnight stay. The bathroom was a surprise, large, spacious with a double shower cubicle rather than a bath. Lovely toiletries too! Tea and coffee facilities are available in the rooms and a mini fridge for your own drinks/food, although the mini bar can be filled by the hotel if you wish. We did not have breakfast in the hotel but we had lunch in the Aston bar. There are some fantastic lunch offers and we were pleasantly surprised to find fish and chips with homemade tartare sauce for half price.....fantastic value and the homemade chips were the best!! Great happy hour offer between 5 and 7pm, unfortunately, we were out and about so missed this. We did return to the hotel bar at around midnight on the Saturday night. It was reasonably busy with a great atmosphere. The barman was friendly and made me a cocktail to suit my tastes! Thank you! Overall, we were not looking forward to staying somewhere a little further from Piccadilly Circus than we'd normally choose, however, we were so surprised by the fantastic service, lovely room and great restaurant and bar offers, not to mention the proximity to a tube line, that we wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. Thank you :)","en"
"1072",4,"Ibis Styles Excel has an excellent location. Just across the road from Custom House DLR station, so extremely easy to get to the O2 and central London from the Hotel. The hotel was also easy to find from the road and signposted from the DLR station. Room was clean, tidy and up to the usual Ibis standard. Bathroom was extremely clean, quite small, but a small bathroom is normal for Ibis. Reception staff were very friendly and helpful. The only issue we had was at breakfast. We got down to the breakfast room half an hour before they stopped serving and the buffet was not being topped up, so had to wait for hot products as the staff seemed to be concentrating on clearing up so they could go home. In fact as we were waiting for the food to be cooked the staff really didn't want to know and customer service was lacking in general from the breakfast staff - a little more training on how to deal with customers and teaching the staff to acknowledge them and to learn / understand English is required. Other than at breakfast we had an excellent stay.","en"
"1073",5,"Comfortable and conveniently located. Would have preferred if breakfast included in price. Staff efficient, friendly and professional. My only real gripe was that due to the scaffolding at the window the room was made gloomier than it should be.","en"
"1074",5,"I had a very pleasant stay here. The room was great, food was good and bar was excellent.

Travelodge are definitely on the up.","en"
"1075",4,"I stayed here during my recent business trip to London 24-28 February 2014. The location is very strategic and perfect for both business (my office is just 5 mins walk) and pleasure (shopping, sightseeing, cultural trips, etc) not to mention easy access to different parts of London as Piccadilly Circus and Green Park tube stations are nearby while plenty of bus routes to choose and taxis from the main streets. The room was neat and tidy - exactly what I wish as I was only in the room to change clothes after work then off to see London in the evening and only returned late in the evening to sleep before heading out again to work in the morning. The concierge had always been helpful and attentive especially when it came to find a taxi. For a 4-star hotel the Cavendish is an excellent choice. However their service to customers need to improve as I notice compared to a 3-star hotel in Asia, the Cavendish is struggling. The room make-up was poor as they changed my bath towels and restocked the biscuits and tea only after I called the reception. And this happened more than once. The receptionist in the evening was an English gentleman who had been very polite, cheerful and helpful - typical English service that you would expect to get. However in the morning or afternoon the Eastern European ladies reminded me typical service of Soviet Union era when I stayed long time ago in hotel in Prague back in 1989. I would definitely give Excellent rating for the Cavendish if they improve their reception and make-up room service.","en"
"1076",5,"Iwas there with my family: the room was not too big, no wardrobe (just a small space for few clothes) no electricity outlet in the bathroom (for shaving). but it was very silent, the quality of sleeping was good, it is clean and the personnel were very kind. the position is strategic: near the city, few steps from the metro station (aldgate east). very tipical english breakfast, with only toast type as bread (not ham, not cheese).","en"

"1079",4,"This hotel was located in the nice neighbourhood of Earl's Court. It was really easy to get to - convenient from Heathrow and to the tube. Plus the double decker buses were only a block away. It should be noted that this was a safe neighborhood. The hotel itself had decent sized, clean rooms. However, the beds/pillows weren't the best. Kinds of lumpy. The room itself was nice and clean. One of the main features of the hotel was the nice breakfast buffet they had every morning. Plus the free wi fi. I would recommend this hotel to anyone.","en"
"1080",5,"I have just returned from an overnight stay at this hotel and I am impressed. It was my first stay at a Premier Inn and I wasn't disappointed. It was just a 10 minute bus journey from Euston Station on either the No.73 or 476. And a 10 minute walk away from the Islington Assemly Hall, where I was going that evening for a concert. The hotel is located in a great location....Angel Tube station, is a few minutes walk away...buses into the City are a plenty...ie... no 19...to Holborn...Tottenham Court Road....No.73 Oxford Circus..Victoria...Pleanty of resturants...Sainsbury's, Marks & Spencer & Waitrose are a few minutues walk away...Along with Chapel Street Market. The staff were warm and very friendly. The receptionist, who greeted me on arrival was fantastic, I arrived early and she arranaged for me to have an early check in, which I appreciated as I was feeling a little unwell. I stayed in a double room, which was quite large. The bathroom was a goodsize with a shower unit over a bath. The bed and pillows were fantastic....Very comfortable, I had a great nights sleep and I had to push myself to get out the bed the next day, as it was so comfortable..... I look forward staying at this hotel again....true value for money and great staff....","en"
"1081",3,"A friend and myself went to ME London for a weekend. Everything was nearly perfect from the time we checked in until the moment we checked out, I would actually expect the reception to provide us with newspapers of our choice delivered to the room, something that a 5 stars like ME should bear in mind! The check in was quick and convenient We was then shown to the rooms and given a little tour of the hotel :-) Our room was in a very good size! The room was clean and was kept that way throughout our stay. I would recommend paying the radio bar a visit, lovely atmosphere, try to avoid the gold diggers though! LOL .. The gorgeous lady in the radio me bar reception was friendly and professional. Since I am from the middle east I wanted to place an order for halal chicken or meat while dining in which the restaurant neither dining in hotel provide therefor I was very limited within food option and have to place an order from takeaways! Even sea food options was very limited indeed., I would recommend that you bear this in mind as for middle eastern guest would be interested in dining in with halal options available! The concierge staff was helpful and would do anything you may request them to do and they’re to help you!","en"
"1082",5,"There is nothing to criticize: staff was nice, room was clean and large (especially in London), the restaurant was good both for breakfast and dinner. The only minus was the room allocation: 2 of our 3 rooms were just in front of the lift. We could have changed rooms but would have been a mess. Disappointing room allocation. As an hhonours member, I would have expected rooms on the hh floor and not so poorly located.","en"

The rooms were inviting and comfortable. We each had a suite with out respective partners and our son and his wife found the rooms to be child friendly and also the hotel provided a childs cot free of charge. We did have to wait an hour for each room but the reception is very nice and comfortable and the hotel provided free drinks for our wait. We could watch the fireworks from the harbour wall which was a bonus. We can recommend this hotel whole heartedly all the family had a fabulous time and we are planning a return when we all get together in London again. A very good hotel.","en"

I checked out after one night and felt a bit threatened by the reception man when I told him I was leaving. Also I was not happy about the state of the bedsheets. All in all not a good hotel choice for me. A park bench would have been as comfortable.","en"
"1087",4,"I stayed 2 nights at the Crowne Plaza, it was perfectly fine for a business trip. The DLR station is about 3-5 minutes walk away. It's a quiet neighbourhood I would say, eventhough the hotel was quite busy due to the gymnastic championship which took place at the O2 Arena. The staff was very helpful and friendly. Check-in procudures take longer though than at other hotels I would say. Breakfast buffet was excellent. The Spa area was alright as well. Overall, I would definately stay there again, especially the rates are quite reasonable for this kind of hotel.","en"

"1091",4,"I recently had a one night stay at this hotel for business - location is great, right opposite Gloucester Road tube station and very accessible. Lobby area, bar and restaurant are very modern and really nice to chill out in. The room however was something else: I had been upgraded from a single to a double, and thank God I was as it was the smallest room I have ever stayed in. If you pulled out the chair at the desk it touched the bed. It was certainly compact! Having said that, the bed was comfortable and the room had everything you'd really need: it was just so small you wouldn't want to spend any time there. I had some issues with the room: heated towel-rail didn't work, minibar on but not chilled, hairs left in plug in the sink, ""free"" Wifi was really slow and often wouldn't connect. Overall: ok if you're just going to sleep there, but not if you are intending to spend any longer at the hotel than a day. I had a ""traditional"" room style (i.e. in need of updating) but perhaps other modern rooms are better. I will add that I received an email survey on my stay and the hotel did respond to my issues well straight away, which was encouraging.","en"

The outside of the building looks like a 1970s office block and our room was overlooking a car park and some bins. The room wasn't in any way soundproofing so we unitentionally became very intimate with the couple next door - we head them coughing, burping, using the bathroom and even stirring a cup of tea. After a long day of sightseeing the last hting we needed was to be constantly disturbed by other people's noise. disappointing.","en"

We found the staff to be willing to go above and beyond to make our stay as comfortable and enjoyable as possible. Their advice on the local area including bars and restaurants was great and nothing was too much for them. Every time we entered or left the building we were offered tea or coffee and asked about our day. This even happened on our final day after we'd already checked out but had gone back to collect our bags they'd held for us which is a great free service they offer. The area is great with plenty of places to eat or drink within walking distance (there is no restaurant or bar in the hotel so many around offer discounts to people staying there, I suggest you check with reception) and Victoria Station is less than a 5 minute walk away. Would definitely recommend for the price and would 100% stay here again!","en"

"1102",1,"My colleague booked this hotel for another of our work colleagues in January. She paid by credit card which had sufficient funds on it and had a reservation booking confirmation email sent through. Our work Colleague turned up late at night and told no room was under his name or the company name by a very unhelpful receptionist. Colleague then paid a further cost for another room after thinking accommodation hadn't been booked for him. When he called into office we clarified we had an email and called the hotel and spoke with a lady called Marianne who couldn't find the booking, but once given the reservation number on the email found it. She then said she would get the money swiftly refunded. Credit card statement has just come through and money has been removed but not refunded as promised. Another call made today 24/2/16 to discuss this problem, my colleague was told by the male receptionist on duty that he was too busy to help and after she asked to speak to a manager and he hung up. This is the worst kind of service you can expect from a hotel, this money have been taken and should be refunded as soon as possible due to the hotels cock up. Further action will be taken with this matter if the hotel manager fails to contact the company and speak to us within 24 hours.","en"

The hotel itself is a lovely grand dame of a hotel. It embraces its deco-era heritage without being outdated or old fashioned. It feels fresh!

"1104",5,"We enjoyed 2 wonderful nights at this hotel. We had a super king room, it was cosy and beautifully decorated with rich vibrant colours. It was very clean, house keeping and the reception enquired if all was to standard - which it was. Our room wasn't ready on check-in which was ashame - but we had a brief tour of the hotel and took lunch in the conservatory. We had a 3 course meal included, though the options were limited, we enjoyed our meal both nights. The breakfasts both morning were a real treat and I must say the soufflé pancakes were incredible. This is an amazing hotel, which is worth every penny. What really makes the hotel are the staff, who are from every corner of the world, they were so friendly. This is a hotel which isn't pretencious, where every guest is treated as a friend. I will come back to the milestone and hopefully the hotel will still be the same. Thank you very much.","en"
"1105",4,"On arrival the receptionist (who i believe could be the managers daughter) was rude and spoke to us like children, she was the one with the language barrier not us! We were not shown to our room (which was in the basement). We had to drag our suitcases down a horror movie starcase or squish into the tiniest lift in the world. When we entered our room through a tiny door it was like stepping into a lunchbox. The wardrobe and dressing table space was adequate but then we got to the bedroom. A window with bars on with no light coming in so it is hard to tell what time of day it is, a double bed and a single bed squished into a space that you couldn't swing a cat in! We don't want to mention the stains on the bed! Bathroom-don't even ask, just beware of sticky floors and an ancient shower head. On to the full english breakfast...WHAT full english breakfast? Cornflakes, Branflakes, boiled egg or (processed) ham was the question our lovely receptionist (now waitress) asked us. Plastic cheese, a random yoghurt, a not so fresh apple and toast are placed in front of you and you must choose from the other delicious items! No sign of bacon and fried eggs anywhere. To sum it up this hotel is the worst i've ever stayed in, it shouldn't be allowed to be open!","en"

"1108",4,"Booked this hotel for a romantic weekend to celebrate 24 years of marriage. The reception and staff are very good; however when you get to your room, that is when it goes down hill a tad. Very very small rooms - NO AIR CON - I stress this as we went when it was sunny and it was like a sauna. They do provide a fan, but all that does is circulate hot air (a bit like a fan oven). The water was warm at best. The lifts are a pain. We were waiting for 10 minutes for one to come along. Being on the 7th floor, the stairs where not an option with our cases. Breakfast was OK - buffet style, but the restaurant décor looks like a 60's motorway service station. In essence, I would have been better off at a Premier Inn or travel lodge.","en"

The variety of breakfast is not the biggest but no doubt complete. Very close to the tube station. Thank you to all staff for being a good part of our holiday. Very much recommended if u are not intending to stay right on the shopping street. U are just 2 to 3 tube stations away from shopping areas and various tourist spots.

"1111",4,"London is full of great budget hotels, sadly this isnt one of them. It was a bit tired, and the little things not thought through, like a bathroom door opening inwards so you can barely open it. The building itself is a bit tired and could do with some smartening. The lack of place to eat / have breakfast is a downer. That said the location is pretty decent, a shortish bus ride to the West end, and the Bakerloo line is close, as the station is across the road But the biggest problem is the price,it seemed comparatively one of the higher priced Travelodges I've seen in London, and I'm afraid, that I cant see why Overall, an ok option, and if you find a cheap deal then go for it, but there are better options at the same price","en"

"1114",1,"This hotel may have a connecting bridge direct to Paddington Station however; this is about the only positive feedback I would give. The front desk staff are clueless and when posed with a problem would rather walk away then continue to discuss and find a solution. In addition the only bar serving drinks that night had been rented out to a private party for the night, meaning all hotel guests have to sit in a cold lobby with no drinks. If someone asked if I would stay here again the answer would certainly be no, and it has certainly put me off using any hilton hotel in the future.","en"

"1117",5,"My husband and I just returned from two separate stays at the Marylebone and each was sensational. I had mixed up our first reservation and reserved a smallish standard room instead of a suite, which we preferred. Although a crowded weekend the staff arranged for us to move into a bigger room the next morning. When we returned back to the hotel after several days of hiking in the Cotswold’s, they upgraded us into a beautiful private suite on the 7th floor. The staff could not have been more accommodating on all fronts, from bellboys to front desk. The concierge made two restaurant recommendations (and reservations) that were fantastic. Marylebone is a wonderful quiet neighborhood that is just lovely for strolling, taking meals and window browsing. Marylebone Hotel is our new go-to place to stay in London.","en"
"1118",4,"We stayed here for a week. First floor room, right above the breakfast/bar area. Maybe it's because we live in a city anyway, but the pub noise some complained about was not an issue for us (we actually both commented that the room was really quiet ... except for the sirens outside and the music from a different building on a Saturday night). Room itself was very clean with giant ceilings. Our shower needed to be resealed (sorry about the puddle of water on the floor each morning...), and the drain was pretty darn slow. I hadn't specified the type of double room, so we ended up with two twin beds instead of a single bed (stupid American here =) ). Beds were comfortable, though, and we were quite happy with our room. Breakfast was great, though the amount of food and speed of cooking really varied day by day. The traditional English was lovely; the eggs benedict were good though not so runny; the coffee was amazing. The assortment of cold things also varied day by day -- the day I ordered porridge, they didn't have any fruit out. =( The staff were really, really wonderful! I think they made the whole place. We were arriving late on a Sunday -- past the time they normally closed -- and someone offered to wait for us. We also left early -- before the time they open for breakfast -- and they let us check out the night before. They really do want to make sure your stay is just perfect, and are incredibly accommodating. The neighborhood is pretty awesome -- ten minutes north on Shepherd's Bush, you hit another area that has a ton of food options. Five minutes south, you're at the underground station with a mall and more restaurants. The city center is a 40ish minute ride away, give or take. There could definitely be some little upgrades here and there, but overall, I was happy with what we got for the price we paid (though do bring a copy of your reservation -- I ended up paying more when we checked out because I'd forgotten the booking price and agreed with the bill. Whoops.).","en"

"1122",4,"The Hoxton is a fantastic place to stay in London - clean, comfortable and friendly. The breakfast in a bag was great - just enouh to get you started each morning, the bedding was clean and comfortable (feather pillows - dreamy!) and the bathroom was equipped with a power shower. The towels aren't changed daily so you need to remember to hang those up and the rooms aren't huge but they are big enough if you are only there to sleep! The service charge in the bar is one to watch out for and they do charge your credit card upon check - in probably to ensure you don't 'do a runner'! (but they release the funds again when you check out if you don't spend the £40 they 'capture'). The area is near to the city and transport links are adequate - the only hurdle is finding the hotel from the tube station (took us a while but we got there in the end as it's down a bit of a side street). The Hoxton is situated in probably not the 'best' area of London and we did feel a little wary walking back there after our night out. Also, non residents use the bar and restaurant regularly. All that said, we would definitely go back - but would try to get one of the special rates rather than pay full price.","en"
"1123",4,"Absolutely super hotel with great attention to detail. The hotel is located on a quiet street away from traffic. The rooms are clean and quiet.

The good thing is that they have an ironing room, which means you don't have to wait for the iron to be delivered to you room. Breakfast was ok....nothing special, but good enough to fill you up. The gentleman on duty at breakfast in the morning was very pleasant, welcoming and provided great service. The pub in the hotel also has a great atmosphere, good pub food, good service and a pool table......which was important for my ego :-) All in all an average hotel, but good enough to attend events at the London Excel.","en"
"1125",5,"In choosing a hotel to stay in London is not easy at the best of times, however the Novotel London Waterloo ticked all the boxes. We were looking for a hotel that was not in the prime tourist areas but close enough so that travel between the sights would not be a burden. We also wanted to be near a tube station or on a bus route and a safe area to walk around. We also wanted a hotel which was well presented, good staff and good facilities. And we found all of these requirements in the Novotel London Waterloo Hotel. The location was perfect, just one bridge away from Westminster, the London Eye and all of the associated sights around the area. The tube station ( Lambeth North ) was an easy 6 minute walk through a very safe neighbourhood and there was a bus stop right outside the hotel door, with different city routes available. And the hotel itself was very modern, with comfortable rooms, a very good dining room and the best of all, outstanding staff to assist the guests. The tariffs were very competitive and reasonable, particularly if you book and pay in advance. I can absolutely recommend this hotel, particularly for the leisure traveler and families.","en"

I am really sorry for not remembering their names but the Italian and the Latvian ladies were probably the best receptionists we have ever met. We had to wait for a while for our room to be ready since we arrived 1,5 hour before check-in time. During that time they offered us coffee, they helped us warm our son's food, they helped us with our luggage and all that with a smile. We even asked them to keep a bag of frozen baby food in the restaurant's freezer which room service brought to our room every day with a smile. Every time we passed by reception the ladies would not stop playing with our son and making him laugh and smile. 5* service The room was just perfect. They had arranged for a baby cot for our son. No problem with space. The standard room was quite spacious. Comfortable bathroom, a sitting area, a big TV and they even arranged for a small fridge to accommodate our son's food during our stay. The room was really really clean. The daily cleaning was spot on. The cleaning ladies transformed the room into what it was on the first moment we arrived every morning. 5* Rooms Prices were much lower than many 4* and even some 3* hotels in the area. Value for money 5* Being a business hotel we were afraid that having a baby might cause issues and complaints. To be honest though, we were very very quiet during our stay. The residents and guests were really really friendly, all of them looked on business trips and all of them were really eager to have a quick chat. Breakfast was not included, and we didn't manage to visit the restaurant for lunch or dinner so I cannot comment on the two. I definitely recommend this hotel to anyone. The location, the service, the rooms, the receptionists are all 5*. We are definitely returning to the hotel the next time we visit London. Our stay was wonderful, we and the baby faced no problems, and we really enjoyed everything.","en"
"1127",5,"I recently stayed at the Waldorf Hilton for two nights in early June for business. The hotel is in a great location near the Thames, Trafalgar Square, Covent Garden and Leicester Square. My room was nice, and I was thankful to have air conditioning since it was rather warm outside. My room was rather small, but it wasn't a problem for this trip since I was by myself. I also appreciated the breakfast buffet that was included with my room charge. There was a wide selection of cold and warm foods as well as drinks. The only negative thing I can say about my stay was the slow to non-existent service during breakfast. The first morning, I wasn't asked or able to get coffee until I was half-way through my breakfast. The second morning, I was in a rush and wasn't offered coffee until I was essentially done with my food. However, I should say that this was only a minor inconvenience. I would definitely stay here again or recommend this hotel to a friend or family member.","en"
"1128",5,"Went to London for a long weekend with my sister and mother and was blown away by St. Martins Lane. The hotel itself is beautiful and our room was pure indulgence. Amazingly comfortable beds, ample wardrobe space, plush carpet, you name it. The staff was extremely accommodating with all our special requests (computer charger, earplugs at 11pm when my mum really started snoring etc). Our fantastic dreamy bathroom was complete with tub and super nice toiletries from Malin + Goetz. The hotel is not only clean, friendly and happening, I thought it was also a fun place to stay. Alex, Amy and Joey are all great concierges who gave us brilliant recommendations. Alex especially managed to get completely in tune with what we wanted to do during our stay and we went to some fantastic eats (and we're all extremely picky foodies) on his advice. Altogether 100% greatness on all levels, I would definitely come back, and definitely recommend warmly.","en"
"1129",4,"We liked this hotel - nothing flash but clean and comfortable right next to the London Bridge Station so we could commute to Gatwick - able to leave luggage during the day, checked in early without any hassles, good breakfast. Staff very helpful. Walking distance from many of the ""need to see sights"" - felt safe, near the River Thames etc. Comments from grey nomads.","en"
"1130",5,"We enjoyed our stay here. We used to live in Hackney and return to visit family so we know the area well. We took a family room, which was (surprisingly) quiet, more spacious than similar hotels we have stayed at and had comfortable beds for all four of us, which, again, makes it better than other, similarly priced hotels in the area. We found the staff very helpful and personable. Breakfast was good and quite a good deal, too - £17.50 for all four of us (a kids-eat-free deal was on). The only problems are 1) parking. Overnight parking is available nearby at £10 a night but the hours sounded problematic (like not opening until 11 on a Sunday). 2) We asked a member of staff to book us a cab but we were quoted £14 for a minicab trip that cost £8.50 in a black cab.","en"
"1131",4,"I stayed for the week beginning November 2nd, 4 nights, whilst on business in London. The hotel was easily found, a minute from the tube and adjacent to several bus routes. Check-in was swift, and everywhere was brand new. The room itself was spacious, excellent bathroom and plentiful towels and hot water. Daily cleaning service was efficient and comprehensive. Most of all, the room was quiet and I wasn't disturbed at any point. I had dinner in the hotel restaurant one night, very good. One major complaint: the 'free' broadband is almost unusable, unless you want to send/receive a couple of small emails and nothing else. The only usable internet was the paid for 'premium' service, which admittedly was only £15 for the week. But I would say don't offer something 'free' if it really is below standard - just looks like a marketing ruse. That aside, do stay here on business or pleasure. Booked ahead I got a really good rate for the week.","en"
"1132",5,"From the staff of the hotel, its friendliness, rooms, catering services and to the location are unbeatable. Five minutes from the most important monuments of London, to be able to walk, as well as all kinds of transport for longer travels. Excellent hotel. You are not a simple client. You're something else for them., service, rooms and even the location, unbeatable.","en"
"1133",4,"Hotel is ok: I've stayed at this location twice. The location is very good with lots of pubs, stores and 2 tube stops right up the street. It's much better to stay here in the winter than in the summer because they don't have air conditioning which was horrible. No fans where available either we asked the front desk. Other than that the rooms are small but clean and it's a good value.","en"
"1134",5,"This was my second stay at the Grange and I remain impressed. Immaculately modern hotel, with attentive staff, good size rooms with all amenities, and a short step to Tower Hill tube and Tower Bridge and Tower of London. Good deals available if you look online. We got a 2 night stay including breakfast for £110 per night. Highly recommended.","en"
"1135",2,"Having booked our room via late bookings website, on arrival we seemed to be treated like second class citizens. Asked to pay a £25 per night deposit even though we had already paid upfront. We were not advised of the services available to us. Room overlooking a building site and building work going on on the floors above and not advised of this at the time of booking. Customer service awful, our treatment poor. Will never stay at the Park Plaza again. Disappointing experience.","en"
"1136",5,"The Capital is a jewel of a hotel hidden in plain sight in Knightsbridge, very convenient to the Knightsbridge Tube station (and Harrod's). It is the antithesis of the large chain hotels. You feel immediately welcome and the service is warm, accommodating and personalized. This was my 3rd stay at the The Capital and it was delightful. The room was clean and comfortable and the staff couldn't have been more friendly or hospitable. We enjoyed a very well done high tea in the tea room on our arrival, and then breakfasts in the main dining room in the mornings. The food in all cases was fresh and delicious. Top rankings!","en"
"1137",2,"I booked this hotel for an inexpensive, easy stopover before an early train from Euston Station. It was moderately inexpensive by London standards, but it was poor. Stale rooms, poor quality bedding, no iron, no hair dryer, no wifi in the room. When I found I also had no shampoo, I was told I'd have to wait until housekeeping opened after 8:00 in the morning -- after my train left. The place is massive and they just can't keep up. The lobby looks like an airport terminal in a snowstorm because everyone's sitting on the floor and everywhere else trying to use the one wifi location in the hotel (which doesn't work well, by the way). Bottom line, if you have choice, skip this place.","en"
"1138",5,"We stayed for 3 nights in this lovely hotel, beautifully decorated with quality towels and king size bed. The bathroom was superior with proper shower. The continental breakfast included in the price was the best variety I have seen with a good selection of fruit, juices, breads, pastries, meats and boiled eggs. A fully cooked breakfast is offered for an extra price but we found the continental to be very substantial. Lovely staff, spotless rooms complete with Nepresso machine. I read a review complaining no wine glasses in the room, we simply asked and it was no problem. A small fridge would have been good but overall I think this hotel is super value, situated in a beautiful quiet residential area opposite Kensington Gardens but with transport, restaurants and shops within a 5 - 10 min walk. Would definitely stay again and recommend to others.","en"
"1139",3,"Stayed here whilst on business in Feb 16. Rooms are very small, in need of refurbishment and a bit of TLC. TV set was very old and small. Heating was too hot, even when turned down. Windows did not close so noise from outside. I would suggest the hotel spends money on refurbishment of the rooms. Hotel staff were friendly and attentive. Breakfast was a good buffet selection of hot and cold options.","en"
"1140",4,"Lovely hotel within walking distance from the West End. Rooms were clean & of a high standard. Air conditioning & lovely comfortable beds. Could do with extra milk but aware we could have asked. Hotel staff were extremely friendly & helpful. Only downside was the cost of breakfast, opted to go elsewhere","en"
"1141",4,"booked last minute and only stayed one night but very impressed. Big comfy bed and lovely staff. Very happy. Only small niggle some may find is that my room was quite small - perfectly adequate for one person for a night but i imagine if you were there for a few days you might prefer a larger room. For me though absolutely no complaints.","en"
"1142",3,"Overall hotel feels like 1980. Marble and dark carpets. Very dated from every perspective (rooms and common areas). Room on 4th floor was very noisy. Could hear every door opening and closing near and above my room. Shower felt dirty (who still uses a curtin ??), and water temp kept changing. There is no a/c in room. Bfast was ok. Nothing special at all. With very expected and basic variety. Location is poor. What's so interesting beeing near tower bridge? You see it once and then you are stuck far away from everything. I won't be back.","en"
"1143",3,"Room was clean and tidy but the bathroom had faults which although did not detract from our stay should have been spotted by staff. I basically was doing their job by suggesting that the showerhead be cleaned or replaced so it acted like a rainfall rather than spurting out at all angles. The soap tray in the shower needed refixing as it was hanging loose and the rod was missing from the pop-up plug. I wouldn't have bothered to mention these items but a housekeeping manager was in the room when we returned and asked if everything was Ok. She was most attentive and got on to maintenance who called me and I advised them what was required but I requested they do it after we had checked out the next day. Breakfast was taken mid session and quite disappointing. I know it is difficult for restaurants but I have had much better meals in far cheaper establishments. Be wary of the plate heater which could burn as it had clearly been turned on early and left on high. Oven gloves needed to handle plates. Chef was great, selected warm plates. Eggs fried to perfection. Black pudding was dry and tasteless. Italian dinner - tiramisu recipe had vital ingredient missing - Marsala. If it was there it couldn't be tasted. We sent it back. Don't get me wrong, it's a nice place to stay and the views great (we were happy overlooking Waterloo with the Shard and Canary Wharf in the distance), but one would expect a little more attention to detail for the price. Other contributors have complained about allocation of internal rooms which the Management have been too polite to point out that the information is there online. ""Some of them with atrium view"". Also, whilst it does say ""superior room"", that really is a misnomer as it is the lowest class of room available. I wonder if PP can say what it is superior to. Floor to ceiling windows are great. Recommend the express online checkout but make sure you do it as the very last thing you do. Let me be a mystery shopper PP!","en"
"1144",4,"The Aspen Suites provide me with a lot of what I need on a business trip: a great location for public transport within London or trains to other cities, an apartment with cooking facilities and a washer/dryer, a free internet connection (though remember to bring a connector cable from your laptop to the wall socket), and a very high standard of cleanliness. Granted, some of the furniture is getting a bit tired, and the breakfast is monotonous (though plentiful), but this is Central London and you can do a lot, lot worse. In my experience, the staff are friendly when treated with respect and courtesy. Most important of all for me is the high standard of room cleaning.","en"
"1145",4,"Very good hotel with good location. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Check-in and check out was fast and efficient; wifi was good Room clean and comfortable, suitable for a few nights. Highly recommended.","en"
"1146",4,"Ok well first off, it's a very nice hotel and if you have $$ to blow, go for it. Because apparently $300.00 isn't enough money to acquire a room bigger then the size of a large closet and a window the opens to a brick wall.... That's #1. #2: The woman at the counter told me when I signed my paperwork that I would get the VAT tax that they tacked on back at the airport... silly me was unaware that you can only get VAT tax back on GOODS not SERVICES and the lady behind the counter mis-informed me. When I spoke to the hotel about it they told me they would refund me that and it has yet to happen. Clearly they do not follow the ""customer is always right"" policy when it comes to refunding people money due to mis-information from desk clerk to customer. Very frustrating. And I mean, the hotel bar is just full of old men on business trips... not cool for young tourists who dont like to be taken advantage of.... The older male bartender I had was awesome though... wish i could remember his name...","en"
"1147",4,"We received a warm welcome on arrival and our rooms were ready before 12 which was a bonus. We booked 2 rooms for five of us and paid using Avios points. At check in we were told we actually had 3 rooms allocated as they had no twin rooms. Great to be able to spread out a bit. The rooms were of a good size, quiet and with huge comfortable beds. No in-room wi-fi but free in public areas. We used the Kilburn subway which is less than five minutes walk away and on the Bakerloo line., 15 minutes to oxford circus.The area has lots of cafés and shops and feels safe.The staff are helpful in recommending restaurants should you wish to dine nearby. We didn't use the car park - thought £60 was expensive. Instead we parked using Just Park where you park on someone's driveway and pay them. I would definitely stay here again.","en"
"1148",3,"Whilst the hotel is in an excellent location for transport links they were incapable of dealing with what was clearly a busy week. Arrived at 2pm for check in to be told no rooms available for an hour - one magically appeared after we kicked up a fuss. Restaurant was chaos, waited 20 minutes for a drink, an hour for food after ordering and a minimum of 15 minutes for a table each morning at breakfast. They regularly ran out of plates and glasses which when eventually replaced were so hot they warmed up the milk / orange juice.. Our room looked tired - whilst clean there were marks on furniture, walls and the carpets. To balance this review the food (when arrived) was good quality and good value and they looked after our bags on our last day to give us another full day in the capital.","en"
"1149",4,"My husband and I stayed at The Sumner for 2 nights, early July and were very pleased with my choice of accommodation (yes, I researched here on Tripadvisor first, then shared options with my husband). The Hotel is located in a side street within couple minutes walk of Marble Arch tube station. There's no big hotel sign on the building, just a discreet brass plaque next to the front door. Good choice of restaurants within a few minutes walk of the hotel. Check-in was efficient and friendly and we were shown how the door keys work (they're slightly different to the usual hotel swipe keys). The interior is very smart and spotlessly clean; nice artwork in the lounge, where there was a computer for guests' use. There are two flights of stairs and two separate lifts to various bedrooms, as the hotel consists of two townhouses. Reception is located at the rear of the hotel, which was a bit confusing on arrival. Our room (109) was on the 4th floor (lift available) and overlooked the road; it was very spacious by London standards, although the en-suite shower room was compact in comparison (according to my husband: seemed fine to me!). Furnishings looked brand new and towels were thick and soft. Nice touch to have complimentary bottles of mineral water in the room. Note: no tea/coffee facilities in the room, but you can order hot drinks from reception for a reasonable charge. Breakfast is included in the room rate and is taken in the basement breakfast room, which is very light and bright. There's a good choice of fresh fruit, yoghurt, cheese board, bread and crackers, juices and hot dishes. Certainly enough for a good start to the day. If you don't need indoor pool, spa, restaurant, room service etc, and are looking for a central location at a very reasonable price by London standards, The Sumner may well be the perfect hotel for your London stay.","en"
"1150",5,"We had a wonderful stay at the Savoy on our final day of our UK holiday. Though we were staying in the lowest tier of rates, we were treated like royalty. The rooms are stylish, large and super comfortable, with the ability to cool the room at night and many lighting options that actually enable you to have bright light as well as atmospheric light. Both are very rare in my experience. You were left with the feeling that you were a guest from the era of Downton Abbey and in a quintessentially fine London hotel, not a bland hotel anywhere. We dined at Kaspar's and enjoyed it so much that we went back on two other occasions. We would love to stay again.","en"
"1151",4,"We booked this hotel for a two night theatre break, taking advantage of a special offer on room upgrade to executive and free breakfast. The hotel itself is in a near perfect position just off the Thames opposite the London Eye, close to Charing Cross mainline and Embankment Tube station. Most of the main tourist areas are within easy walking distance (Covent Garden 15 mins, Oxford Street 25 mins, Trafalger Square 5 mins), as a result we never had to use the tube. The public areas of the hotel are impressive and very clean, while the staff are very friendly and attentive. Our room (executive) was quite large by London standards, air conditioned and extremely clean with a large bathroom containing both a walk in shower and a full sized bath (with tv!) The bed was probably one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in, so much so that on the morning we checked out we stripped the sheets off to try to discover the make of the mattress with a view to buying one. The breakfast was fine, mainly because it was included in the room rate, otherwise paying £17.50 a head might have spoiled my appitite. As usual the drinks and snacks were pricey, but very good quality and served impecably. Would use again.","en"
"1152",4,"Came for business but had an extra day to spare: getting to the centre of London is easy with the underground jubilee line a couple of hundred meters away. Breakfast is very good, with quite some choice between sweet and savory. The rooms are fine, quite spacious with limited view (was on the 9th floor). Very nice executive lounge on the 14 th floor with great views on London. The hotel has its own underground parking (extra cost 20 pounds) which is tidy and connects directly to the hotel. In short, an ideal hotel for anyone on business.","en"
"1153",4,"On a recent vacation to London we wanted to be situated outside the congestion zone but on the public transit line. A Buy-2-Get-1-Night-Free special at this ""5-star"" hotel seemed like a great option. First to debunk the marketing. The large glass tower shown in all the pictures is not the hotel. The Marriott is a 6-story brick building on the back side of the glass tower. And as for 5-star, the doormen are aggressive and staff are everywhere like in a 5-star, but the hotel is decidedly 4-star, which is to be expected at the available room rates. Hotel location turned out to be fantastic. It is in the heart of Canary Wharf, with excellent restaurants and pubs open late, a DLR line next to the hotel, and daytime shopping and post office across the river walking bridge. Try Bar 38 and Brown's for dinner! The room was nicely appointed with a comfortable bed and outstanding bathroom. It's worth mentioning though that there is an unexpected tile step into the bathroom which will stub unsuspecting toes! Parking is expensive in a car park one block away, internet is not free in the room or the lobby despite the vague description on the website, and breakfast is not included. The mall across the way has a few good options, though. Overall a good experience.","en"
"1154",5,"We stayed for four nights and would come back any time. Friendly staff, cosy hotel bar, small but clean rooms. Ideal for sightseeing. Tube and buses round the corner. Nice pub ""Prince Alfred"" nearby. It was my second stay at the Phoenix and I'll come back again.","en"
"1155",4,"This was a nice, midweek afternoon tea with a friend. The staff were lovely and we never felt rushed. We had a good selection of teas to choose from but some carried an additional cost as they were apparently more expensive but we were alerted to this before we made our selection. We had endless cups of tea and were provided with lots of extra hot water and we were offered more sandwiches after we had eaten the selection we were given, which was lovely. We had quite a few dietary requirements and all were met with the staff coming over to check each time about what was ok and what was not and the staff appeared to take a lot of pride in the care they gave us and were very attentive. The cakes however, were only ok and my cake slices were a bit dry but the scones were good and we were supplied with loads of jam and cream. The price was not the cheapest - £31 without any fizz (that was an extra £10) but it was still a really nice afternoon in a nice central location.","en"
"1156",5,"This is a wonderful location right in the heart of Canary Wharf. The hotel was superb. Check in officially 3pm but we arrived to book into car park at noon and were told our 2 rooms would be ready in 10-15 mins so we waited in lobby until housekeeping informed reception that rooms were ready. 5 mins to tube. No view at the back of the hotel but the other room at the front did.","en"
"1157",5,"Unfortunately I was only in London for 1 night on this visit (my first to this hotel) and I could not fault it and would have liked to have stayed longer. My room was extremely comfortable, clean and very quiet so I had an excellent night's sleep, Staff were lovely particularly those on Reception. Having acted on previous reviews I ate breakfast fairly early so the restaurant was quiet and there was a good selection of well-presented food. I managed to get a very good rate(for London) and would definitely return.","en"
"1158",5,"Staying here for the second time this year, we were pleased to see that a 'hot breakfast' option has now been introduced. Golders Green is a typical Holiday Inn Express with all the usual facilities and high standard of cleanliness. Our room was on the road side and over the bus stop - suprisingly we were not bothered by road noise, although we did keep the windows shut. We travelled into the City using both the bus and tube. The bus from outside the hotel takes around 45 minutes straight through but can take considerably longer if travelling at peak times. The nearest tube station is Finchley which is considerably quicker. A £7.50 day travel card is very good value, covering the tubes and buses, if you intend to do some sightseeing. The hotel parking is free. As with most hotels wi-fi is chargeable which seems unfair when most pubs, restaurants & shopping malls can provide this service free. Overall a good choice if not wishing to pay City Centre prices.","en"
"1159",4,"I stayed in a single re furbished room on the 7th floor for 5 nights. Rooms were great and clean but bathroom is tiny but manageable. Breakfast is supplied each morning but it wasn't anything great. I upgraded to the buffett breakfast but that was a waste of money. The eggs were overcooked and like rubber and still had the same food as the continental breakfast.....Check in was fast and staff were helpful. Very busy hotel so staff aren't really friendly but are helpful. Located right near Russell Square underground, it's centrally located to get around London.....Nice restaurants near by. I would stay here again if I was in London.","en"
"1160",4,"Got lost looking for this hotel due to the chaotic roads in London and my sat nav being tempermental and not finding it......but a quick call to the hotel reception and they were able to quickly guide me to the right location. spent 2 nights here and was given a room with a garden view, although small it was perfect for the job of just a place to rest the mind from the hectic london life , a true haven for the tired body and being in the back of the hotel outside noise was minimal except when it rained heavy on the first night where the rain lashed onto the conservatory roof. The coffee machine was a godsend, just what I needed in the morning especially when I skipped on the breakfast as I found it hard to wake from a lovely nights snooze. The hotel is conviently located and only just a couple mins walk from north ealing tube station which took you directly into the heart of London quickly and being not far from chiswick gave me the opportunity to dine out in decent restaurants. gutted didn't get the chance to try out momo, will have to next time.","en"

The shower was in the bath so not separate, only criticism would be the room is a little dark (ladies applying make up) otherwise a wonderful hotel, lots of character & very central if you are going out in east London. It's also very quiet at night - you can't hear any outside noise!","en"
"1163",4,"Hotel location is good. Arrived after very long hot journey. Was pleased to see some iced melon water at reception BUT it was empty. Tapped the container a couple of times in the hope the receptionist might offer to refill it but no luck. Check In was easy and we were told we were upgraded on our room which was a nice touch. Room was nice, view was looking inside the rest of the building, nice view of the air con units etc. Went into the bathroom and the floor tiles looked like well, lets say a gentleman had missed the spot!. Don't think he had just think the tiles must have worn that colour. Above the loo there was a large chunk of tile or grouting missing which spoilt the look of the room. Dropped off our cases and went down to bar for a drink. The bar was not busy but the bar staff did not seem in any hurry to serve us. As others have reported were quite ""offish"". Asked if there was somewhere to sit outside and enjoy our drink but ""no"". For thoese that smoke I suppose you would have to just stand outside the front of the hotel. In the morning went down for breakfast, very busy. Was shown to a cramped table. Again staff a bit offish and a bit short in number. Table not set properly, only one teaspoon. A leaflet on the table told us we could have a selection of breakfasts. Asked the waiter for full english but no you have to do self service. S S had only powdered? eggs and some of the rest of full english but not all. Asked for fried eggs but then had to gamble how long they would be before we went to get the rest via S S. When to get S S and had to wait in q by which time our eggs had arrived and were cold. Note for Hotel. Why not take the order for eggs whilst people are getting the rest of their breakfast? Also you need more staff at breakfast. Left shortly after.","en"

"1165",4,"We had the opportunity to travel to Europe this June and stay in three different Intercontinental properties. My husband is a platinum level Priority Club member as well as Ambassador. We decided to pay for the nights at this hotel as it was the least expensive of the three. Upon arrival, our room was not ready (it was early) so we had a (very expensive) cup of coffee in the lounge before heading upstairs. The public spaces of the hotel are modern and upscale. The room was an upgrade as per the Ambassador program. It was a nice size and newly redecorated. The bath had a full tub and two sinks. There was a large flat screen TV, a large closet and mini-bar stocked with glasses, mugs and a teapot. The room was well-maintained during our stay and the sheets and towels were high quality. The bed was very comfortable and black-out curtains allowed us to sleep well. The room was quiet and the area was very nice. Two tube stations were nearby, the closest but less convenient was Hyde Park Corner. We found ourselves using Green Park, a slightly farther walk but more lines available. Shepherds Market was very close, with a number of restaurants and pubs. It was a very pretty walk from the hotel to Buckingham Palace. Hyde Park was just up the block. Overall a great location. Service in the hotel was pretty good but we did have an issue with the Concierge. At first we got a reservation for a French restaurant when we had requested something British. A new reservation was made and confirmed via note from their office, but when we arrived at the restaurant they had no record of it. Fortunately there were able to squeeze us in but it was somewhat embarrassing. In defense of the hotel, when brought this to the attention of the management, they were very apologetic and reduced some charges on our bill as compensation. Definitely not a deal-breaker. Because they knew we were traveling to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary, they sent us cheesecake via room service one evening. Very Nice!","en"
"1166",5,"This hotel is very clean, has friendly staff and is fairly close to the Under Ground. It is walking distance to Tower Bridge, Tower Hill and many restaurants. It is a nice spot to stay, but a little further than we wanted from other key attractions. None the less, I highly recommend this hotel. Just be sure to fill up your Oyster Card and plan a few extra minutes during the day for travel to and from the hotel and key tourist sites.","en"
"1167",5,"My Fiancé and I came to stay for the week to celebrate our anniversary. Pleasant stay, double room was small but comfortable. Positives: great location, helpful staff, clean, close to shops, cafes, tea rooms and a McDonald's. Nice area of London. Negatives: 9.95 a day for the internet if you don't opt for an executive room, and it has a 2.5gb download limit. One of the days we returned to the room to find it hadn't been serviced which took over an hour to sort. Food is expensive so we ate out most of the time. Not many channels if you stay in in the evening with no internet. 12.5% service charge added to food bills. One of the times the room was cleaned they threw away my partners full and unopened bottle of cola so we moved any consumables into drawers. As a whole, it was a good trip. I wouldn't pay full price for this hotel (I got mine off lastminute.com) our sightseeing to Natural History Museum, Science Museum, Aquarium and Zoo made the trip worth while.","en"
"1168",1,"Stayed here after traveling back from America to get some rest before an onward train journey the following morning. Location is good as it is right next to Paddington Station. However I'm glad my stay was just a night! Stayed in a room with two singles, the room was cramped, bed was small and I could feel the springs. Did not get a great night sleep and I could hear the elevator all night. Like other reviews have mentioned: mould around the window and bottom of walls, mould in bathroom, etc. Hotel had free Wi-Fi but it didn't work. From what the room was like I didn't bother with the free breakfast. I have had a better night sleep in a Hostels bed! For people staying looking at staying here while on holiday: Look else where, don't get drawn in by the cheap price tag!","en"
"1169",5,"When I first arrived I was given a twin double room which was one more double than I had asked for, after a quick chat with the staff, they ensured me that they would change this for when my wife arrived at the weekend. The following day whilst I was out they moved me on to a fantastic suite. Great trip, great location, great staff. Fun bar too!","en"
"1170",5,"I was very satisfied with everything and I have been severalr times to Melia White House, and it has always been a very nice stay. To my knowledge you do not have to improve the facilities because in my world it is more than good enough.","en"
"1171",4,"problem with the wrong room type initially which was quickly and simply corrected by reception. Missing room service breakfast was more annoying but again saved by good customer care skills of the staff member who got iit in the neck for somebody else's mistake. Overall good hotel would recommend tho the rooms seem a little old fashioned it's clean and tidy and the bathroom was fine.","en"
"1172",4,"We stayed here for my husbands birthday, the hotel is nice but I wouldn't say it was a 5* having stayed in a 4* in London, it was lacking that extra star. on our arrival we was told that we could be upgraded if we waited until 3pm or have the room that we paid for there and then, so we decided to wait, our bags was put in a safe room. On our return to the hotel having waited till 3pm our room wasn't upgrade, to we could of had our room a lot sooner, the room was clean but one of our windows did not close properly, the breakfast the next morning really needs a lot of improving we lined up way outside the breakfast room when we got into the breakfast room there where tables not cleared, the breakfast it self wasn't great (buffet) the beans was cold etc it felt like a cafe the room is way to small for the size of the hotel, it felt like a cafe not a 5* hotel. Like I said lacking that extra star.","en"
"1173",3,"Due to a computer error with our original hotel, they arranged for us to stay at the Duke, the location was good, out of the way. But the rooms are small (we should of had a superior room, which im not sure we did, the window looked onto an alley way, there are no drinks available in the room till they turn down the bed in the evening unless you want to pay way over from the mini bar. This was a birthday treat for my friend, i was told she would get a card and cake left in her room for when we arrived, there was nothing in there so i asked at reception and got told it would be there by 6pm, but nothing then when we went for breakfast she was given a card a day late!!. It was a shame we got moved to this hotel, if i was to book another 5* this would would not be on my list.","en"
"1174",3,"I booked this hotel for a couple of reasons, the location as I had 2 days of business meetings and the location to the tubes and West London was ideal. Also, the price was withing my budget for this trip. The other reson when i booke it was it did not say continental, but just breakfast. On arrive, the lobby was large and clean and the checkin process was efficient. The room and bathroom were compact but ok for a single room (just). The sound insulation was non existant as I was woken up both nights by the person in the next room coughing. Breakfast - When I checked in I made it clear I had not signed up for a continemtal breakfast and expected a cooked breakfast. The staff were un-helpful and would not consider changing this. I was offered a blank piece of paper to write a complaint and they would hand it to the manager (to be honest, I could not be bothered). Anyway the hotels interpretation of a continental breakfast was oriange juice, cerial, bread roll or croassaint. That was it I saw families arrive for breakfast and continue to look for such things as cold, meat, fruit, yoguart etc. I was imbarracing to watch. BTW, I did not see anyone pay the extra for the cooked breakfast which was sitting there under hot lamps.","en"
"1175",5,"This hotel is in a great location just across Westminster Bridge. It's therefore obviously really close to the houses of parliament, 10 Downing Street, Westminster Cathedral etc and an easy walk to Piccadilly / Oxford Street / central london. I was there on business but it was also just a really short walk to Westminster tube station so it was easy to get around. Also easy to find your way back to - just look for Big Ben then cross the bridge! Lots of tourists around that area but is ideal for a tourist trip and a go on the London Eye just around the corner. Room was a good size, modern and spotlessly clean. Unfortunately mine was internal facing rather than overlooking Big Ben or the water so there was the downside of not actually seeing outside (it looked into an internal courtyard) but I knew that when booking and will have meant a slightly better price I presume. It also meant that it was very quiet during the night. Bathroom was spacious and had a large bath and a separate shower. There were lots of plugs which is always a bonus for all the gadgets that need to be charged these days. Breakfast wasn't included which was a shame and was v expensive to buy at the hotel so I didn't sample it. Only criticism is the huge delay at check in. There were a number of people waiting and it seemed to be taking everyone an age to be checked in - I don't know if that was due to the people checking in or the staff but it was ridiculous. It only seemed to take me about 3 mins to check in once I eventually got to the front of the queue though. It's not cheap but it's all relative and for a central london hotel of that quality it is definetly a good option.","en"
"1176",4,"Loved the hotel! Very nicely furnished, pastel-colour interieur, roomy and high-ceiling bedrooms, comfy beds... Took continental breakfast: cheeses, ham, toast, fruits, yoghurt, cereals, tasty and sufficient. Good location for tourist - 15 min riverside walk to Waterloo, Holborn just over Blackfriars bridge, even Govent garden on walking distance. If you don't want to walk, bus RV1 (Tower-Waterloo-Govent Garden) stops near hotel. It crosses popular line 15 as well. We did not use underground at all. Go to OXO tower for night view and don't miss book-market under Waterloo bridge!","en"
"1177",5,"For a reasonably priced London hotel, this can't be bettered for location, room size, facilities, cleanliness. Almost next to St Paul's Cathedral, near so many attractions, a great place to stay. Our room was a good size, a quiet side of the hotel, with a comfortable bed. A small but clean shower room, free WIFI, kettle for hot drinks, & very friendly & obliging staff. A bonus - near an M&S small food store, just right for a few extra bites to eat. We will use it again next time we visit London.","en"

"1179",4,"I'd found a weekday deal for a spa day for two - £80 each for spa access, 25 min massage and 25 min flotation tank treatment. I found the spa beautiful and relaxing, but a little small. The temperature of the pool was lovely and warm. The ceiling had little lights which changed colour. There are foot baths you can fill with bath salts and relax in. A sauna, steam room and a sanarium too (temperature was a bit too cool for my liking). The ice room was out of service, but I didn't want to use it anyway. As for flotation tank, was a bit nervous as thought it was a tank where you have no light or sound. It was more like a dry waterbed massage machine you're put down into. For a weekday it was a good experience as me, my friend and another lady were the only ones using the facility. If there had been a few more people it would have felt crowded. Overall, a nice, peaceful relaxing day in a beautiful place.","en"
"1180",4,"This is my third time at this hotel in the past 6 months and I have been pleased on each occasion. The hotel is located near Marble Arch, Oxford Street, Hyde Park and several tube stations are within easy reach (Marble Arch & Edgeware Road). The area is fine and I've always felt safe walking to / from the hotel. My most recent stay was for 2 nights. The girl who checked me in (a trainee) was very friendly and made me feel welcome. My room was nice, with two double beds, and was very spacious. A nice touch were the chocolates on the pillow. Complimentary water would have been nice - given it's 4* rating, but overall I had a lovely stay and would definately reccommend the Marriott Marble Arch.","en"
"1181",4,"We have visited London for weekend breaks over the past two years and stayed in the President Hotel. Very happy with location, breakfast, local restaurants ans bars. Russell Square park and park beside Great Ormond Street provide lots of green area. No issue with noise- stayed on upper floors. After three stays here, we recommend this location frequently to our friends for London visits","en"
"1182",4,"Well it was the first day branded as a Hilton and was a completely manual checkin. Queues of people and prob 15 staff, reems of paper,took some time to get the door card. Appears they were having technical issues :) All very apologetic and friendly though, these things happen and the handled it well. Hot cookie for each customer was a nice touch. Up to the room. Very nice, clean and funky. Lovely bathroom albeit very cold bathroom. Smaller room than average but had everything and more. iMac TV/computer nice touch. View into the atrium was a shame, would have been nice to overlook London but hey (it was a free HHonors reward stay afterall). No minibar but you get a fridge if you brought your own drinks. Any probs? The iron blew up with a fizzle bang just as I finished ironing my shirt, that was the only prob with the room. Signs in the hallway are really bad - you can get lost finding the lift. They need to sort that out. Facilities? we had a drink in the Sky Lounge (£14 for 2 drinks) and took in the views of london. Pretty impressive - busy.. Nice enough. Breakfast? Very good. order Full English from menu with loads of options and served on the plate (not a buffet). Tasty, good quality grub. Great for morning after. That's about it folks. Happy stay in a surprisingly modern hotel. Convenient location near to where I wanted to be.","en"
"1183",4,"This hotel was chosen when we booked a package to London. This is the only hotel that the ""EasyBus"" from Gatwick stops at, so was ideal. It's only steps to the Underground station at West Brompton so getting around central London was a breeze. The room was clean and adequate. There is a pub on site with good food, a little pricey but after walking all day, a delight. The included full English Breakfast was fabulous, plentiful, lots of choice, terrific staff. There were also a couple of nice pubs nearby. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to London.","en"
"1184",3,"I had some concerns after booking this theatre break when I read some of the negative comments on here. I can only conclude that some people just enjoy moaning,we found this hotel to be outstanding. All the staff were polite,helpful & enthusiastic,the room was immaculate,comfortable & well equipped & the breakfast was absolutely lovely. Also there are not many London hotels with swimming pools & spas so this was a right bonus. There were complaints about location but it was only 10 mins walk to the tube (Barbican) so don't know what the fuss was about,we would definite stay again.","en"
"1185",4,"The Bedford is located close to almost everything, the staff is very friendly and helpful, the rooms are clean, and it's reasonably priced. There are a few things to watch for though: I was given a room with a bed that was so uncomfortable as to make it unusable, but they were quick to make a change to a room that was much better. The rooms also can get very hot and stuffy, and if you're in a room on the front you can't leave the windows open at night, or even in the day, because of the noise from the street. They did offer me a fan, which solved that problem nicely, but they required a deposit, to be returned on checkout. I found that a little strange but not a big issue. Overall it was a pretty good experience.","en"
"1186",5,"I had seen an article concerning the renovation of the hotel, which looked spectacular! So decided to make a reservation at the Gilbert & Scott Restaurant for our first night in London. Wow, wow what an experience we had! What a great night full of surprises! I had notified them that we're in London as part of a special ""Make A Wish"" weekend for our Son who is 12. We ordered our Starters, I had the Crispy Pigs Head and my Wife and Son had the Crab. The Pigs head was Devine, well presented and tasted fabulous. At this point the we were told that Marcus Wareing was going to come over to our table to talk with us, 5 minutes later he turned up and presented my son with a signed copy of his Book and spent 15 mins chatting with us. We then went onto our Mains which were Venison, Grouse and Steak for my son. He was extremely happy because they presented him with an extra round of Chips with his Steak. Again the food was presented well and tasted out of this world. The restaurant has a great atmosphere and is absolutely beautiful! At the end of our meal to round the evening off, we were given a guided tour of the Kitchens and the Hotel. Besides our special treatment, this would have been a wonderful evening spent at the restaurant anyway, we will never forget what they did for us.","en"
"1187",5,"This Hotel exceeded our expectations! We only stayed for one night, but the Hotel was clean, bright and central! The staff could not have been more welcoming and helpful and polite and the room and facilities were excellent!","en"
"1188",5,"Booked through secret hotls and was slightly worried it may be stuffy, how wrong we were. The experience from start to finish was a joy, We arrived at 10.30 to drop our bags off and our room was ready! We were asked if we wanted to change our deluxe room for a very slightly smaller one with a river view, which we did at no extra cost. WOW. We over looked the River Thames, the London Eye, the Gherkin and the new Shard, the view at night was breathtaking. The room had a fab bed, an amazing shower and all the goodies and extras that you would expect from a hotel of this standard. All the staff were helpful and friendly. The food was delicious. The location was a hop skip and a jump from Trafalgar Square, so very central. What more could you ask for.","en"
"1189",5,"Fantastic hotel, superbly located 2 minutes from Russell Square tube station on the Piccadilly Line. The hotel is a small boutique place that oozes class. The one downside is that in my opinion the windows aren't sufficiently well insulated so there is a lot of street noise in the rooms. Russell Square stays busy until very early in the morning and we found ourselves woken several times during the night by drunken tourists shouting outside. Maybe we were just unlucky and perhaps a room at the back of the hotel would have been quieter. Overall absolutely superb, highly recommended.","en"
"1190",5,"I arrived at the hotel on the 6th August at 2pm and expected to be checked in promptly as a Platinum Elite member of the IHG rewards club. Unfortunately there were only two receptionists on duty and the long and unacceptable delay in waiting to be checked in was frustrating and annoying. I do hope staffing levels will be increased especially at 2pm when guests [especially large groups] are checking in. I booked an executive room using my club points and was allocated room 629 which I have to say exceeded my expectations. The room was clean, bright and modern. I particularly liked the large bathroom and the huge television. Thank you for the kitkat chocolate bar and complimentary water. Much appreciated. Now for the negatives: Complimentary wifi at a very slow speed for club members is not acceptable when there are much better speeds on offer but they are charged at a premium. All wifi should be free. The air con in the room was bliss but very noisy and constantly rattled which I found annoying during the night. I made a phone call from the room telephone. The call lasted 13 seconds and was to a local 0208 London number. I was charged 0.98p for a 13 second phone call which I would say is a rip off. There is no information regarding the call charges in the room. Holiday Inn Bloomsbury is a nice hotel very centrally located and the Management have certainly kept the hotel in tip top condition but there is room for improvement and I hope my constructive feedback will be noted and actioned.","en"
"1191",3,"read reviews on here that simply arent true, you get what you pay as and for the price i couldnt complain, the room was clean and the beds had fresh sheets and bedding on, we had a towel each with bar of soap, tea/coffee and fridge in room as well as lcd tv which worked fine. this hotel is close to all links and in a great location. it is ideal for a place to lay your head after a day exploring. if you want luxury then pay luxury prices but on a budget this hotel is fine. would use this place again, i couldnt really complain for the price we paid, bathroom is small and could use some updating but like i said you get what you pay for.","en"
"1192",5,"We adored it here. Travelling with a child only 5 months old, we were accommodated in every way possible. The rooms, service, cleanliness and restaurants are fantastic. And the room service (used quite a lot) a lifesaver! We can't wait to return this coming Easter.","en"
"1193",5,"Stopped in this hotel for two nights in January. Approaching the hotel from outside, I did have some second thoughts, as the purple lighting and imposing facade give it a somewhat gothic, and supernatural look. This carries on into the reception area, which whilst very clean, has lots of wood panelling, ornate carvings and black chandeliers. It could definitely pass for a themed haunted hotel and reminded me of the tower of terror hotel in Disneyland. Even the staff attire appeared to be themed. What a pleasant suprise then when I got to my room. Reasonably sized, extremely clean, complimentary box of chocolates, fruit and wine and nice and warm. Hot shower or bath, complimentary items in bathroom including toothbrush and toothpaste (very welcome as I'd run out). Didn't have much interaction with the staff, but they were very pleasant. Would definitely stay again.","en"
"1194",4,"I stayed here with my family on a Thursday night. We had booked a family room and I'd asked for a cot and a child's bed. However when we arrived there were 2 children's bed and no cot, but one visit to the front desk and a few seconds later a cot was delivered to our room. Every single staff member we encountered was polite, professional and friendly. I didn't know breakfast was included in our price, and I was extremely impressed with the array of breakfast items on offer. We never heard any planes until the morning when we were getting ready to leave. The room was clean and had everything we needed, but I did miss a clock in the middle of the night. I would DEFINITELY stay here if we went to London again. The DLR train line was frequent and not too far from central London.","en"
"1195",5,"The hotel looks sharp, clean and modern, and we were greeted with a smile by the person at reception, who made us feel very welcome. When checked in we were handed over personally to the concierge who was to escort us to our room so that we could be shown how to use the high tech touch panels to operate the various items in our room. The hotel is only a couple of minutes walk away from Old Street station on the northern line making it very accessible when travelling in and out of London City centre on the tube. When we returned to our room in the evening, we found a nice message from Daisy, the Guest Experience Manager, congratulating us on anniversary and birthday celebrations, which we thought was a very nice touch. We found the bed very comfortable and we had a choice of pillows. Checkout wasn't until 12 on the Sunday which meant we could make use of the leisure facilities which were open from 8am. The staff running these facilities were very helpful and showed us where everything was. If we decide to do a city break in London again, I would definitely consider staying at this hotel again.","en"
"1196",3,"Have stayed there twice now. Brilliant location. Close to all the sights, couple of streets down to Covent Garden really fantastic location.

"1197",5,"Since this hotel opened in 2008 I have use this hotel often on my business trips to London and rate it very highly. I was there again in January 2013 Very good location in the City of London , This is a true 5 star hotel catering for the business traveller , very good rooms , fantastic bathrooms , good restaurants and bars The staff are first rate but to me the best features are the business facilities , meeting rooms/ conference rooms . If you are on business in London and need a complete venue this is in my opinion the best hotel","en"
"1198",3,"Okay, I was here as a corporate guest so it's very hard to make a judgement on value and service because I was being looked after ... but I just thought this was one of those 'trendy' hotels that doesn't quite make the grade. Some examples: the wi-fi wasn't working and the receptionist said she would get back to me with a solution, but never did. The air-con was going full blast all night and proved impossible to turn off (odd for an eco-hotel). The room lighting is dim to the point of awful. You need extra instructions to work the shower etc etc. My room was on the ground floor front and the laundry truck delivered at 3am ... then the bins were emptied at 6am .. you get the picture. On the plus side: stunning views of the river, excellent food in the restaurant, good facilities. The hotel makes a virtue of its 'out of the way' location and it's great to see this bit of London being redeveloped but do bear the location in mind if you're booking here. PS: the number 170 Bus from Victoria drops you outside the door and you don't have to brave Clapham Junction station","en"
"1199",1,"First the positive things about the hotel. There's a bed, the water is hot, the rooms are clean and the staff seems friendly. But here ends the good things. There's no options for breakfast at the hotel. Here you need to go out into the near area to find a suitable restaurant. The rooms have a total lack of furniture. There's a bed but that's it. Nothing else. Not even a cabinet, so you have to leave your clothes and belongings on the floor. The floor in the shower is completely flat meaning after a shower the floor is full of water and wet. My room was right next to a street with a lot of traffic and very noisy. So I didn't get that much sleep. In my opinion it's a hotel for people that doesn't need sleep, food or comfort. Terrible for business people, horrible for families...","en"
"1200",4,"Had a 2 night stay in this hotel. Brilliant budget hotel for central London, only a short walk from Kings Cross Station. Clean rooms with comfortable bed and lovely hot water.

"1201",5,"We arrived back from 3 nights at the Soho Hotel yesterday and wanted to share our experience. Firstly, from the moment we booked to the time we checked out every one of the staff we encountered were friendly, helpful and professional. We would especially like to mention the excellent breakfast staff in Refuel, who couldn't have done enough for us. We stayed in a Junior Suite and booked the family package as we travelled with our 9 year old son. The room was lovely, bright, extremely spacious and spotless. Our son had a large sofa bed that was packed up by housekeeping each day to allow for more space until bedtime, when it was remade at turn down. We had some problems with the air conditioning but the hotel was quick to send someone up to fix the issue. I'd like to make mention of how accommodating this hotel is for families. They went out of their way to be lovely to our son and there were lots of little extras with the family package. We had mentioned in an email prior to arrival that it was our son's birthday during our stay. We were amazed at how much of a fuss the staff made over him from the moment we arrived! I would like to especially thank the lovely Marta in the Refuel restaurant for making his birthday one to be remembered. I lost count of all of the little special surprises that popped up throughout the entire day and the number of staff who wished him a happy birthday. The icing on the cake was when Marta arranged for us to attend the Kids Movie Club in the hotel theatre, complete with a buffet lunch, popcorn, and some bubbly for the adults. A great idea, even if you are not staying at the hotel. All in all the Soho was a fantastic experience. While it isn't cheap you certainly get a 5 star experience with outstanding service, a convenient location and a lovely, relaxing space to stay in the centre of the hustle and bustle of London. We hope to come back.","en"
"1202",4,"The location is excellent-- 2 blocks from the Kensington High Street tube station. The hotel is ugly on the outside but is nice on the inside.

The concierge was very helpful with directions. There is a Boots and a Whole Foods a couple of blocks away on High Street. There is a great coffee shop on the way (Caffe Nero) where we did breakfast a couple of times. The Marks and Spencer near the tube station is also a great place to get food and take back to your room. .","en"

In fact, we have been so pleased with our stay that we are writing this review after 6 days here and still with one day left on our trip. The staff and the hotel are wonderful, especially all of the day staff and in particular the concierge, Seyl. Check in was smooth and friendly, help with our bags was immediately offered, and suggestions on London was informative and helpful. Breakfast was a great continental and the staff there were extremely gracious and welcoming. The room was clean and well appointed, and the cleaning staff were also very friendly and courteous, consistent with the rest of our stay and interaction with the hotel staff. The location was very good, too. A short walk to Kennsington/Hyde park and other sites like the Natural History Musuem. For other main sites, The London ""Tube"" is very easy to use and the pick up stop is a short walk from the Ashburn. Within several stops (only a 5 - 10 minute ride) you are at other major London attractions. And there are several good pubs and restaurants of different levels within short walks, too. We also found the value for the hotel to be good, especially in light of the US dollar against the Pound. We would definitely look to stay here again and were happy to be here. We would definitely","en"
"1207",2,"The biggest disappointment was our breakfast never arrived. We paid for breakfast included and left the order on our door for room service. i understand things can go wrong and was not complaining or kick any fuss about it. However when we did notify reception i was shocked that we were being blamed for it. The receptionist on Saturday morning said, 'you probably didn't wake up'. Even though one of us was awake at the 10.30 - 11am time specified. without an apology and no room service charge on our bill, clearly it was not our fault. We checked in after 10pm and were left with a small room which i was disappointed with. Happy to pay for any upgrade available i was declined the option and was given the reason 'its because of Wimbledon'! Better to not give an excuse than give one which clearly is not true. I will not stay at this hotel again and will be writing my reviews for others to see.","en"

Plenty of natural light coming across from Hyde Park. The rooms had tea/coffee, safe, iron/ironing board etc. Good quality toiletries etc. Breakfast was good.

"1210",5,"Booked into the Marriott West India Quay for one night, on Saturday 3 August. Found the hotel just a two minute walk from West India Quay DLR station. Two doormen greeted me and opened the door and reception was bright and airy, the staff very efficient. Booked into Room 802 which had a good view of the dock, very quiet room, well maintained with ample amenities. The corridors were incredibly hot, which made going back into the room with air con, very appealing. Walked to Canary Wharf Underground station, about 5 minute stroll, had a quick drink in the Atrium Bar which was pleasant, tho not too cheap. Slept very soundly in my large double bed, no noise from fellow guests which is always a plus, woke refreshed on Sunday morning, showered and left, check out was a little delayed, due to the fact of having only two staff on duty, not sure why, but once they checked me out, wished me well and I walked out, again with two doormen opening doors for me and wishing me a good day.

"1212",5,"These were my 3rd and 4th visits to the hotel. I choose it because of the outstanding friendliness and service of the staff, in particular this visit, Gunther and Diana. I also choose to stay at the hotel for the very well equipped gym (with a variety of classes) on site, and the location (not far from Bond Street, near Marylebone High Street and the super healthy Good Life cafe is around the corner).Finally, the beds and linens are quite comfortable and the rooms are relatively sound-proof. I was near the elevator and had windows to the street but never heard any noise despite being a light sleeper. On these trips, I stayed in the less expensive hotel rooms (Superior, I think they're called) and these are starting to feel a little worn - desk drawers don't close, bathroom tiles are showing some age and there were problems with the desk outlets in both rooms I stayed in (223 and 425). Also there was dark hair in both bathrooms. I alerted the hotel to the issues and I suspect given their level of service, they will attend to these things. These are not major issues and are easily overlooked given the continued stellar service of the staff at The Marylebone. I also see it as excellent value for the money and recommend it to friends and colleagues needing a place to stay in central London.","en"
"1213",5,"Absolutely loved our family holidays thanks to exceptional staff (David and Al Jay), clean brand new hotel and tasty food. Will recommend and come back when possible. There's no parking but seconds away from dlr railway to city. Goes every few minutes. Even better then by car.","en"
"1214",2,"Booked two nights here for a concert we were attending at the Carling Academy in Angel. The hotel is perfectly located for this arena being just a 15 minute walk away and the hotel is also in a reasonably nice area. However, its location is NOT Kings Cross despite its name, so dont fall into that trap! We went to Kings Cross station and then spent almost 20 minutes trying to find it. On arrival, they told us the nearest tube was in fact Farringdon, however, we never even found that station. The hotel were really helpful though in telling us that the easiest option was the bus. The number 19 and 38 buses stop just 10 minutes away and go into central London stopping by China Town or Piccadilly. The 38 also goes onto Victoria station which was handy for us needing the Gatwick Express. The hotel itself was nice and clean and the staff friendly and helpful. The rooms were not the biggest but were very clean if a little dated. The bathroom was not the biggest but was sufficient for its purpose! Having got a great deal on Lastminute.com, added to the hotels nice location and ease of transport with the buses, I would definitely recommend this hotel for someone wanting a nice cheaper option for Central London. One warning...dont use the hotels shop! 85p for a packet of crisps is a little over the top in my opinion!","en"
"1215",5,"We have stayed at Sofitel St James before and we loved every moment and after consideration of this and other quality hotels in London decided on Sofitel St James to host our wedding. From the moment we were in contact with Francesco (Wedding Co-Ordintaor) everything went smoothly and to plan. The customer is at the heart of the Sofitel experience and from day one we were made to feel like VIPs. Nothing is too much trouble and Francesco is the very epitome of professionalism. The whole team made it an extremely special time for us from the menu tasting and fine detail to the upgraded suite on the day with complimentary delicious champagne and cake! We had opted for a late afternoon wedding which was held in Mayfair Suite by Westminster Registrars and was beautiful, made more so by the hotel florist (Dawson Flowers) and their stunning arrangements. We enjoyed canapes and champagne in the foyer and a wonderful buffet meal with unforgettable beef fillet in the Westminster Suite each course being punctuated by our West End entertainment (performed and organised separately with Tansy Aked's Too Darn Hot ensemble). It was the most magical evening. We knew we could totally rely on Sofitel to make it amazing. Special thanks to Vincent and his team (Head Chef) for the stunning food, the best wedding planner in the business - Francesco and GM Nicolas who made special allowances for our 'extended' family. All our guests had a wonderful evening and were very complimentary of the staff, venue and food. Now before this turns into a protracted Oscar style speech, a final little word about the general accommodation. Spotlessly clean, the most comfy bed I have ever slept in and a breakfast you can re-visit over and over. Can't praise the experience enough. My husband and I had the best day ever and we thank you so much. Until we meet again ...","en"
"1216",4,"we ended up at this hotel randomly through a hotwire deal where you pick a ""mystery hotel"" for a cheaper price and were very happy here. it is about an 8-10 min walk from the vauxhall tube stop (check a tube map - it's a bit out of the way and you will need to change lines to get most places but it's not that big of a deal). the rooms are huge compared to other rooms even in london where we had stayed prior, and was very nicely furnished. probably the most comfortable night we spent in 2 weeks in europe. our room had a nice view of big ben and the thames river. of note, they are doing construction next door currently but since we spent very little time in the room we didn't notice at all. overall nice place","en"
"1217",5,"The hotel is so close to Holborn station. The check is quick with automated check in computers if there is a queue. The staff are so friendly! Breakfast was nice Buffett style cooked/smoothie/cereal/cakes. Also very good price in middle of London!","en"
"1218",5,"Close enough to get to places but a little off centre where you don't get caught up in the hectic activity that is London. Particularly good for Westminster and Victoria areas - good local bus and close to Pimlico Tube - only £7 to Victoria train station. Lovely clean and fresh hotel - nice bar area where you can eat - which we did and enjoyed a cocktail - overall a great place to stay.","en"
"1219",4,"Stayed here for business purpose (was booked via conference organization). Check in went pretty quick, friendly staff. Size of the room is OK, seperate toilet, bath tub and shower. Had to pay for WIFI! (19,90€ for 30 days / of € 9,90 per day). Wifi connection in the room is poor. After checking in - noticed that the cooling system in the room did not work; kind receptionist told me to send a technician up next day - never seen. Open the room is not an option (as right above the trainstation). Matress hard, synthetic pillow. Breakfast is ok, enough choice. Scrambled eggs made of egg-powder, did not look like eggs. Staff at breakfast and in the bar very friendly. Considering the price paid en the total impression of the hotel, it had not been the best value for money experience.","en"
"1220",5,"This time there can't be any thing other than a five star rating. We arrived on Friday afternoon around 2 pm after an uneventful tube ride from LHR. We approached the check in desk and were greeted friendly by the check in staff. I handed over my HHonors card and we were soon checked in to our Executive room on the 10th floor. I have stayed here before but it was the first time from Mrs. Erikderek. Our room was as expected; a nice touch was two pieces of cake and a printed welcome letter to Mr and Mrs. Erikderek and a separate welcome back Mr. Erikderek card, a nice gesture. The bed was comfortable; pillows and blanket were fluffy and comfortable. Besides the bed there where a work desk a comfortable chair with a separate foot rest and coffee table. Wi-Fi had good speed and coverage, even with three devices connected simoustainly in the room. The only thing I missed was drawer to put cloths in, there a wardrobe with an n built in safe, a good thing was that the safe was big enough to fit both our camera and our 13"" lap top. If I should write something for the hotel to consider, then it would be to start thinking about refurbishment, since there are some tendencies in the rooms, especially around the bathroom door facing the bath room and the working desk that starts to show some worn and fatigue, but this is a minor, and I have an eye for those kind of details. We had breakfast in the Executive lounge for our stay, I asked for gluten free bread for my breakfast and freshly toasted gluten free bread were delivered to my table on a separate plate straight from the kitchen to avoid cross contamination, this is not always the case when having hotel breakfasts, but Hilton London Tower Bridge did this excellent. We had evening drinks and snacks in the lounge, a good selection of hot and cold snacks. After arrival on Friday afternoon we had the Afternoon teas in the lounge, good selection of teas, sandwiches and pastries, regarding to Mrs. Erikderek the sandwiches were good and scones with clottered cream and jam was also good. The staff all over the hotel as always friendly and attentive, the staff working the lounge did particular good job and gave good service. The area surrounding the hotel is very nice and my kind of environment, lots of interesting architecture and mix of new glass and concrete with old buildings that been renovated. There are lot of take away and drop-in restaurants around the hotel and Borough High Street area, we had some pints and drinks at some of the pubs in the area, one worth mention is The Royal Oak just off Borough High Street The proximity to London Bridge station makes this an ideal location to have as your London base. A few stops to Green Park and from there it's easy to connect to LHR and other location over the City or as we did walk to Regent Street. If you like walk I can recommend taking the tube to Covent Garden and walk from there to Green Park via Leicester Square and Piccadilly Circus (we did a detour walking the Regent Street as well).","en"
"1221",4,"Opposite Marble Arch and handy for shopping on Oxford Street. We had to wait a little while for our room as it wasn't ready but the staff were very friendly so we didn't mind so much. We had a good selection of tea and coffee in our room but no mineral water, that might be normal for London though. There was a fridge we could have used if we had brought our own drinks. Breakfast had lots of choices, the pancakes and waffles were not great but the delicious freshly made omelette of your choice more than made up for that.","en"
"1222",3,"My friend and I recently stayed at the Andaz hotel. We specificlaly asked for a TWIN bedded room and actually paid extra to get two beds in the room. When we arrive at 4pm, we got to the room and it was a King sized bed. We phoned to reception and they said they would send Housekeeping up to split the beds into two singles. We called again at 8pm, before we went out for the evening. We returned at 12.30am and the beds were still not split. We called reception and the manager came up to split the bed. He struggled for 20mins trying to split the beds, but in the end, said it would not split. In the end, one of us slept in the Kingsize and one of us (me unfortunately) slept in a small z-bed. It was very uncomfortable. We were not very happy. To be fair to the Andaz staff, they offered us free breakfasts (2 x £22) and gave us 25% off the cost of our bill. We were happy with their gesture, but if they had resolved the issue in the first place, we would have been a lot happier. Not the service i would expect from a 5 star hotel. I won't be returning or recommending Andaz, sorry guys !!","en"
"1223",2,"We stayed in the hotel for new years. We chose this hotel because it was one of the cheapest and with good location - close to the city. Our room was very warm however the room was very dirty and filthy, the shower did not work. We asked for a better room and the receptionist was happy to give us any other room however every one of them had different issues - some of them were very cold with no heating or very old and dogie windows which seemed very unsecured. We chose to stay in the room that they gave us initially cos it was warm and we used public bathroom instead. Hotel looks much nicer in the photos. It does show in the photos how filthy it is! Although it was the cheapest option we could find we would probably stay in different hotel next time just for the reason of cleanliness and safety of our belongings! P.S. we were not robbed however we did not feel safe because of unsafe doors and windows. But we suggest it to those who are ok to pay less money for a good location and low standard of accommodation.","en"
"1224",4,"Stayed here for a night on a sunday so very quiet but just what we needed,maybe not too central but fine. Superb for visiting St Pauls and sights around the river. Got a deal through lastminute secret hotels £99 room only but lots of local coffee shops and eateries. Slightly dissapointed as we were put in an annexe across a small road so it felt a bit remote from the main hotel and I would ask to stay there next time.","en"
"1225",3,"As a platinum elite member, we booked this room for a pre-cruise one night stay because it was walking distance from two sights we especially wanted to see--the Churchill War Room and the display in Buckingham Palace of Queen Elizabeth's wardrobe. Not only were we not upgraded which is the norm given our Rewards Status, but we were given a room at a great distance from the elevator despite our specific request for one NEAR the elevator and, worst of all, people riding into the cabs on the London Eye could see directly into our room! We had to keep the curtains closed at all times. So much for the view. The room was also especially inconvenient. The furniture was minimal, there was no desk or mirror or any place for a woman to sit and do hair and makeup. The bathroom was also difficult to use because of a lack of outlets for hair dryer and curling irons. HIgh Points: --Great location. Near train and tube stops and in the heat of the Westminster area --Beautiful classic building despite the minimalist decor of the room and the typical garish Marriott carpeting. --Great breakfast served in what was once the library--beautiful room with views of Parliament and the Thames. --Typical comfortable Marriott bed. Low Points: --Minimalist design of the room was inconvenient for getting ready in the morning with no mirrors or outlets. I don't know how female business travelers manage! --Very long distances to walk to many of the rooms. Be sure to insist on a room near the lifts unless you want the exercise.","en"
"1226",5,"Me and my friend went on a vacation to London from Toronto and stayed at the Chelsea harbour hotel, this hotel is very beautiful and is close to Mayfair and Kensington; which where upscale areas with the best restaurants.

"1228",5,"Just returned from a fantastic weekend in London staying at the Novotel Tower Bridge and couldn't fault any of it. We struggle to find good hotel rooms in London that accomodate children at a reasonable price but this was perfect. Check-in at reception took 1 minute and we were off to our room. We had a very spacious room with a 1 x Queensize bed and 1 x large sofa bed for our children (aged 7 and 8) ... a perfect nights sleep was had by all ! Great location 50 yards from Tower Hill tube station and a quick walk to Tower Bridge with many river-side restaurants. Breakfast was also fantastic with great service staff - I also had the best Gluten Free bread I've had in a long time for all you coeliacs out there ! We paid around £130 per night including breakfast for 2 x adults and 2 x children. Would definetely rrecommend.","en"

"1230",1,"I spent only one night there because my flight had been delayed but that was enough to get a good idea. The rooms are tiny and for some reason extremely warm, sauna-like I would say. Keeping the window open is not an option though, not in Westminster and during the night. Breakfast was unedible, too bad to be true.","en"
"1231",5,"Recently stayed here for 2 nights. Room was spotlessly clean with kettle tea and coffee provided and replenished if needed at reception. Staff were very very pleasant and helpful. If you dont want to book breakfast there is a Wetherspoons just across the road. Best to book for an upstairs room as ground floor rooms overlook an alley and a brick wall. This was first time staying at Travelodge but would definitely book with them again.","en"
"1232",5,"I live in Oxford but work several days of the week in Bayswater. Some years ago I was looking around for a good value hotel in the area, close to my office, in which I could stay for a couple of nights a week. I was fortunate to discover the Garden Court, which fulfilled all my desired criteria: it represents excellent value, is well positioned in a great location (with decent restaurants a mere stone's throw away in Westbourne Grove, and Bayswater and Queensway Underground stations just a few minutes' walk from the hotel entrance) and has very good staff. The Garden Court thus makes an ideal base midweek for a couple of nights spent away from home. Diana and her team are courteous, helpful and highly competent, and getting to know them all has for me been one of the real pleasures of staying in the hotel. The Garden Court's rooms and bathrooms are clean and well maintained and offer basic complimentary toiletries. Towels are robust, of decent size and changed daily, and the hotel beds are comfortable. Several rooms have recently been refurbished. Those that face the garden are somewhat quieter than those overlooking Kensington Gardens Square. I don't ordinarily eat breakfast in the hotel, but on the occasions I have done so it has been more than adequate. This is not a luxury establishment: but for the price, location (close to both the West End and Notting Hill), thoughtful staff, and general feeling of being well looked after, the Garden Court is unbeatable value. I recommend it highly, whether to tourists or to business travellers like me.","en"
"1233",5,"Booked a club level room here in grand Royal. The arrival and check in at the reception was very quick smooth warm and welcoming. Whilst checking in, the two lovely receptionists (ALIUS and SVETLANA) happened to ask me when my birthday was and I replied 'twas today. I didn't realise till i actually checked in the room, it was upgraded as birthday surprise to a super luxury suite called ""Lilly Langtry"". The room has its own historic relevance. I just want to end it by saying that it was a tailor made day for me. Thanks so much Alius and Svetlana for making my birthday such a memorable one.","en"
"1234",3,"We stayed here one night for a theatre trip and have stayed here before. Nice room 504 on top floor. Internet expensive and very slow and breakfast service poor. There was very limited food out and the lady in the area was only clearing tables and not topping up food levels. Cramped area when trying to serve yourself. We were using a reward night, but the price seemed very high for those walk in guests. Staff at reception pleasant and helpful. Lift very slow!! Would still stay here again but only on a rewards night or exceptional deal. Please can you put a few more tea/milks in the room. Three tiny mil sachets will just do two cups of tea.","en"
"1235",4,"Having stayed in various hotel chains this one really excelled in every way from reception through to housekeeping, all staff are friendly and attentive. Very high standards of cleanliness throughout the hotel. The restaurent service was second to none and the food exquisite, all dishes freshly prepared with a very notible taste of high quality ingredients and innovative menu ideas. Children are made to feel extremely welcome and staff are very interactive making it a pleasure for children to dine with adults. Nothing was to much trouble we will definately stay there again and it would be our first choice when in London. Our room over looked Waterloo station which interestingly was a very nice view and there is no noise whatsoever.","en"
"1236",4,"We stayed for one night when going to the theatre during Christmas/New Year break. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly. The rooms were standard Travelodge, ours was very clean and well maintained. The location has great access to tubes and buses and is also good for Fenchurch St, Liverpool St and London Bridge stations. If you are sightseeing then The Tower of London, St Pauls, Borough Market and The Monument are within a 10 minute walk. There are goods shops close by, One New Change is close and has big name stores. There are plenty of pubs in the area, try The Counting House if you like real ale. Travelodge do offer breakfast but there is a Weatherspoons (Crosse Keys) just around the corner.","en"
"1237",4,"I booked this guest house to stay in while on a training course and it was ideal as it was within walking distance of the training and there was plenty of places to eat in the area. i arrived late on the Sunday evening to a warm welcome and was shown a lovely large room with everything i needed. The location is in a quiet street with plenty of off street parking and I was allowed to park my car there all week at no extra cost. very clean rooms and fully cleaned every day with fresh towels. Breakfasts were nice and I enjoyed a full English everyday. I'd recommend this place for both business and a visit to London as there is a tube station at the end of the road which will take you into the city centre on the Northern line.","en"
"1238",4,"Arosfa Hotel is a very nice, relatively small, refurnished 200-year old Georgian Town House in the heart of historic Bloomsbury district. We, a norwegian family of four, stayed for two nights, and enjoyed every minute. We stayed in one room with two big beds and a small but modern and clean bathroom. The hotel has a very cozy, warm, english design with that typical english subtile humoristic touch. Delicous breakfast with everything and more one can dream of. We have never seen our kids eat that much - they loved the scramble eggs, bacon, toast, fruits, pastries etc. Speaking of the children - they are two active boys, 5 vs 3 years, and the staff where so nice with them, joking and fooling around. We felt welcomed, all of us. The hotel is located near metro, busses etc. Pubs, restaurants and nice parks almost around the corner. A perfect place to stay for weekend travellers, interested in exploring London life.","en"

"1240",4,"I stayed at this hotel about 14 years ago when it was the ""Great Eastern"". I loved it then and I love it now. My room wasn't the biggest, but the amenities more than made up for the size. The bed linens were really soft, the room was very quiet and the bath products and heated towel bar were great. The service was wonderful, whether it was the 'lobby hosts', the waitstaff in the restaurants and the doorman/bellman. Hotel is in a great location (financial district) and really center to everything there. I dined solo in Eastway one of the evenings and enjoyed the table right next to the open window. Much better than sitting in my room. I held a corporate event in Catch Champagne Bar and the food and service were excellent. Rates are on the higher end, but just not a lot of hotel choices in this part of London. Nice work and well done!","en"
"1241",3,"For £100 for one night is a good price so close to the tube in kings cross. It was a bed for the night . It seemed clean enough apart from scuffed walls and marks on the walls, it just didn't seem maintained enough for me . It did seem very dated . The carpets were not very nice either, but we slept very well and the shower was nice and hot . Then staff were not very talkative . It would off been nice for a bit more interaction at breakfast. They were however happy to get us extra pillows for our room and store our bags after check out time which I found a great help . I felt the pictures on their website looked a lot nicer than in reality . I don't think we would stay here again","en"
"1242",5,"We stayed here for our visit to London. It was amazing. We had breakfast included in our rate and it was better than expected. Everything was so fresh and the service is top notch. This hotel is located right across from Hyde Park and the Marble Arch underground is about a block away. Perfect location. We upgraded to Executive level and it was well worth the extra $. They serve a different "" themed menu"" each night. This saved us $ as we just ate dinner there about 3 times. Highly recommend this hotel.","en"
"1243",4,"I booked this stay off of Hotwire at 50% off. Even then, it was still a decent chunk of change and not the best deal available. I like nice hotels. Keep in mind that I'm pretty sure this hotel is a self-proclaimed 5 star hotel. I'd be a tad surprised if they won any awards granting them a 5 star-tier, here is why. If you are familiar with Fairmont hotels, I would put this place in that same genre. They have great service. The are staffed very well. The room was pretty small, which isn't entirely surprising in retrospect, but there wasn't room for me to unpack my suitcase, for example. The shower was a little frustrating. It didn't get terribly warm. It did however have wonderful water pressure, the downside being that the shower curtain was so light weight that the air pressure created by the fast moving water meant the curtain constantly kept being sucked onto you. The bed was alright, but it was perhaps a little bit too far on the firm spectrum for most people to be comfortable with. They charge for internet! Not only do they charge for internet, they actually charge for bandwidth usage! It's pretty silly and unacceptable to do business like this anymore. Even the internet in the lobby isn't free. There are several other nice hotels right in this area. If I were visiting again I would probably pick a different one and would not recommend this one, unfortunately.","en"
"1244",2,"I have stayed in this neighborhood before, and in fact I stayed in another Radisson Blu around the corner. It really is the perfectly placed hotel within walking distance to so many sights and the tube station on the northern and central lines. I had called the operator for the Radisson and she found me a better rate at this hotel than the other one I had previously stayed at, with breakfast included! I checked four times with her that I was getting a double room. When it came time for me to check in, my confirmation read single room with a twin size bed. This was unacceptable. This was not what I had confirmed with a live human being. She had assured me that it was a double, so why should I bother checking the confirmation? That was clearly a mistake on my part, however they would not help me with the problem that they created. They told me I still had to pay for a double room, which was extra, a lot extra, if I wanted it. They never offered to compensate me for something that I didn't budget for and never requested. The only thing they did was tell me the room would be £30 extra per night verses £40. This was a strain on my budget and started my Christmas holiday on a very frustrating and disappointing note. The room was small, but not horrible, the Internet was slow, and on my last full day there I came back to the hotel around five to get ready for the play I was going to see. They had just started cleaning it at 5:00 pm! I had to wait a half hour before I could get into my room! Plus it always sounded like the ceiling was leaking. I will not be staying here again.","en"
"1245",4,"Hotel La Place is not new, my room (single) was small and the bed oddly located (I don't know how the maids manage to make it up), but it was very clean and quiet. The staff is very helpful and friendly, ready to handle any request 24 hours a day if necessary. Breakfast (full English) is included with the price, and one can select as many (or few) items for breakfast as desired. Wait staff in the breakfast room are friendly and courteous. There is an elevator which goes up to the third floor, meaning a flight of steps to climb if you stay on the fourth floor. My room had a modern shower which was small, but adequate water pressure. There is a large closet with ironing board and iron. Plenty of pillows and blankets. I visited in warm weather and the wall AC unit was quiet and kept the room comfortable, adjustable via a remote control. Several mirrors, including one full length. TV is provided though I was only able to get 3 channels of news and some children's programming. Free wifi is provided, but it is slow. The hotel is located near the Baker Street Underground station, a walk of about 5 minutes. There are many decent restaurants within 10 minutes walk or closer, lots of shops and pubs. I was very satisfied with my experience at this hotel and would definitely stay again.","en"
"1246",3,"stayed here for 4 days in April 2006. I liked the location as it was right next to the Euston Station. Not near the main attractions but if your up for a good walk you can get there in a reasonable amount of time. Room was basic, no-frills, but it did the job. Internet was available in the lobby on 2 computers(for a fee). Food was so-so, but I only ate there once for breakfast... I'd recommend this hotel if you are looking for a fairly cheap hotel in a good location and dont want/need a lot of extras.","en"
"1247",5,"I stayed in this hotel for 1 night. The staff were terrific! very kind and very helpful. I was upgraded, as a platinum priority club member, to their club suite. This was a huge room, very modern and well decorated. The bed was super comfortable and even though I was located on the first floor facing the highway - there was no noise, the windows are fully sound proof. The restroom was great and I even had a flat screen mounted inside the wall so that if I take a bath I can also watch TV. The location is not so good because there is basically nothing to do in that area. But you are 1 minute away from a tube station (Hangar Lane) and getting from there to the center will take about 20 min. Good choice in London if you don’t want a hotel right in the center.","en"

Had the light breakfast which was good, but there are plenty of other options within easy walking distance. Lastly I can't believe Travelodge still charge for wifi access, but you can get wifi from the EAT next door in the cafe :)","en"
"1249",5,"My overall experience of this hotel was excellent, right from my initial phone booking which was handled by a most articulate and courteous gentleman through to an email request for feedback following our stay. I provided feedback and put a comment regarding the TV blaring out loud pop music at breakfast which prompted an apologetic email from the manager. This made us feel like our opinions counted and that they really cared about their customers’ wellbeing. Check in was most efficient and friendly and our deluxe room was spacious and clean. Breakfast was also very good with an excellent choice and good service. The hotel has a contemporary look and feel and we are very much looking forward to using Mercure hotels again.","en"
"1250",5,"We stayed for 2 nights and the mini break was all we hoped for - a really beautiful hotel with great service and attention to detail. We had made request for a quiet room and this was noted and delivered.We arrived early but our room was ready for us and a free upgrade given which made the experience even more delightful. We managed to get a good deal on the internet for room and breakfast and as wonderful as it was I would not have wanted to pay more than we did. The pricing of drinks was such that we avoided the stunning gin bar in the hotel and went to the pub nearby which had its own gin bar.","en"
"1251",5,"Stayed here for three nights and had a really good visit. The location is good: central london and all the main tourist sights are easily accessible by tube (within approx 30 mins). Rooms clean and comfortable, and very quiet. We had a double room with two good sized put up beds for the kids (All beds very comfortable) and a view of the Olympic stadium and orbital. Good shower and bathroom, basic toiletries (soap, hair and shower gel), tea and coffee, hair dryer, TV. 30 minutes free wifi a day/ The breakfast buffet was fine; plenty of it. Quite busy some mornings but the food turnover is very good. Did not eat in the restaurant but the prices looked very reasonable for London. The bar/restaurant was family friendly. As the hotel is located in a shopping centre there is a food court and some restaurants on the top floor. An excellent real ale/craft beer bar is located right next to the hotel. The staff were genuinely friendly and helpful. This hotel must be the bar against which all other Premier Inns compare themselves to.","en"
"1252",5,"Flawless! I enjoyed the stay, the room was very nice, tidy, clean, and had air conditioning which is quite handy. The facilities were as described, and everything was just perfect. From booking, to reception, to check-in and check-out, customer service was impeccable and outstanding. Finally, the property is very nice, and has great rooms, comfortable beds, amazing for the affordable price which made this hotel immediately go up to the top of my list of favourites! And it goes without saying, being right by Victoria Station means that the location is central, well connected, and everything is easily accessible. I highly recommend this hotel and I am surely going back there again, and again, and again :)","en"
"1253",4,"Stayed in a studio apartment run by Jesmond Dene. It was really close to Kings Cross and St. Pancras. We spend most of our days sight seeing. There was street noise and I think the hospital is close. It is a hustling city so you are bound to have noise. Perfect for two people. Lots of restaurants and small markets close by. Would stay again.","en"
"1254",4,"Nice lobby, good staff (overall), clean decent sized rooms. Average food, terrible in room hairdryer, no in room iron, two single beds pushed together to form a ""double"". Two out of three stays, I was overcharged versus my confirmation and I had to did out my receipt and have my bill re-done. The cynic in me wonders how often they get away with that.","en"
"1255",1,"My wife was not happy with my choice of booking this hotel. The room was run down and dirty. The window latch was broken and the door lock and latch were also broken. Anyone could have gotten in our room. The bed spread was old and thin and the bed was uncomfortable. the bathroom was extremely small. The sink was the smallest I'd ever seen. I would definitely not stay there again.","en"
"1256",4,"Needed a hotel close to St Pancras that was reasonably priced bearing in mind that's hard to find in London. This filled the requirement perfectly. Room was small but comfortable and clean. Coffee tea making provided. You could hear the underground rumbling by but that did not stop us getting to sleep. If you want to stay near St Pancras then that's what you can expect. Nice little bar and plenty of restaurants close by. We went to ST Pancras, partly to get our bearings for the morning departure and where we would meet up with our travel group from Great Rail Journeys and found a good source for an evening meal. The morning breakfast was included in the price for the room and was pretty good with all the usual offerings of cereal and English style. Service was good and the staff all helpful. Location was perfect with the station only about 5 minutes away. We had traveled down by train to Euston and walked to the Hotel which only took about 15 minutes. Only had overnight bags as all our main luggage went to our destination in Italy thanks to Baggage Man.","en"
"1257",5,"The best PI that we as a family have stayed at. Clean, comfortable and convenient for the olympics. In a good location for rail travel.

Will definitely recommend this to friends and family and will use again.","en"

"1260",5,"The hotel was well situated across the Hyde Park and near the Underground station. Had no trouble finding the hotel by walking from the Paddington Railway station even though It was our first time in the city. We were happy to discover that the hotel is situated above a gas station with a 24h open store which saved us money and time during the late hours. The staff was helpful and we got to check-in our room in advance. The room was a bit worn but a great view over the park did a great job amending this. The Wifi was fast as well. The breakfast was good albeit a bit expensive. Overall I can recommend this hotel to anyone who doesn't mind the fact that there is a gas station beneath it.","en"

"1262",5,"Great hotel in a fantastic location. Close to Oxford Street for shopping, to the British Museum for museum fanatics, and easily accessible from Heathrow on a direct line (Picadilly). There is a Pret-a-manger right across, and numerous other restaurants, including, on a side street, Sanka, a vegetarian restaurant. The rooms are relatively small, but the bathrooms have been renovated (I took a Superior Double room). I really liked the bath products as well. The reception is really friendly and helpful. The only small problem that I had was on the last night when people in the room next door decided to have a party. I could not use earplugs to block the noise because I was afraid I would not hear the alarm the next morning. The sound proofing is not that great, but I will return without a second thought. Book without any reservations.","en"
"1263",4,"Stayed at this hotel during Christmas Vacation 12/25 - 12/29/2003 with my husband and two young children. The service/front desk staff were very friendly, the room/maid service was responsive and friendly. The rooms were clean, and the hotel overall was decent and definitely a good buy. This is not someplace you'd go on your honeymoon but it is definitely worth staying here if you're on a mini vacation and out doing the tourist thing most of the time. I'd put it in the medium category of a U S hotel, something like a new and well kept Holiday Inn, or Comfort Inn. It isn't fancy but it's in a good location, it's clean and the price is right.","en"

Rusell St tube around the corner from the hotel and a nice number of shops, Waitrose & restaurants opposite the hotel for evening meal. Room was good (upgraded to 6th floor) and the facilities i used in the hotel and the service standards of the check in desk & the concierge were excellent. I had a good stay & I am booked in again for Sep. Good choice of chain hotel for London.","en"

On entering the hotel there is a checkin lobby with some easy chairs ( and easy access to Oscars ) I was allocated a superior loft suite which was well thought out and tastefully decorated. I liked the split level feel and the quality of the furnishings was spot on. I had a good night sleep and the seperate walk in shower was powerful with plenty of room and good lotions and potions to use. I wish I could have spent longer exploring this hotel so have asked my travel department to book me in again soon.","en"

The room (on the first floor, near traffic) was quiet, even with cars going by day and night. The food was better than before (the English seem to have gotten a better pallet). Our bedding was cleaned each day, making for a wonderful night. Not enough good things to say.....","en"
"1269",4,"I booked this as a 'mystery hotel' for myself and young daughter, that said it was in the heart of 'trendy Chelsea'. The hotels are built in the Chelsea FC complex, so it's more football and not so much 'Made in Chelsea'. There is Fulham Broadway tube station, however, about a 3 minute walk away, inside a small shopping centre where you will also find a Sainsburys, Boots and Starbucks, so it is quite convenient for snacks etc there's a nearby cinema too! Also next door is Frankies Sports Bar and a Marco Pierre White restaurant!! It's about 6/7 stops from Victoria. The hotels are 'OK', although there are 2 entrances, one to the Copthorne and one to Millenium and no signs to say where the reception is located (I found it on the 1st floor inside the Copthorne - some signage wouldn't have gone amiss though!). The room was clean, a bit dated but fairly stylish, the bathroom was a good size compared to the hotel room and service was very quick as I had a couple of issues with sockets not working, someone came up within about 5 minutes. Not sure what it would have been like on Match Days but the hotels seemed quite quiet. The mattresses weren't the most comfortable and seemed to sag a bit in the middle, but were OK and each room has its own controlled air con/heater. The hotel served the purpose for us to have somewhere decent to stay to see a few sights and meet up with a friend. It's not great if you don't want a lot of tube travelling.","en"

"1273",5,"My daughter and her husband just spent 3 nights of their honeymoon at the Rafayel and had nothing but good things to say about it! They stayed in a Thames River room that had a very large window which afforded them a beautiful view of the river and lights at night. They were very pleased with all aspects of the Rafayel and would like to make a return visit someday. One of the outstanding things about this hotel is their service and an individual named Taqi whom we had the pleasure of working with after contacting the hotel with some questions. Taqi was very quick to respond to all e-mails and personally saw to it that all of our needs and concerns were addressed. Taqi made the arrangements for a driver to pick up my daughter and son-in-law at Heathrow Airport and bring them to the hotel.. This driver was very dependable, patient, and helpful. We just want to thank Taqi for providing such wonderful customer service!! Hotel Rafayel made a great impression on us largely in part due to Taqi's efforts. We would definitely recommend Hotel Rafayel to anyone looking for a great place to stay in London! You can rest assured your questions will be answered in a timely manner and you will be well taken care of!","en"
"1274",4,"It's hard to find a hotel in a place like London at a tourist price that has a hot buffet breakfast. This is the place, and I would come back again and again. I hate being forced to eat Rice Krispies and that silly salami and cheeses all these places have. Give me eggs, bacon, suasage, etc. As for the roooms ... they are what they are, small, etc. But I go to London to tour, not sit in a hotel room. This place is within easy walking distance from Paddington Station, which is 15 minutes from Heahtrow by train. There are many restaurants all over the place, including a fabulous Italian joint ... Taormina at 19 Craven Terrace. Hyde Park two blocks away, two tube stations within five minutes. No, you don't honeymoon here, and I have peace and quiet because I go at the end of March, not during the tourist season. If you want luxury, pay for it. If you want value because you want to spend your money on trains, exhibits, food, etc. this is a good bargain.","en"

"1277",5,"We have stayed in the hotel about two weeks ago for 4 nights. We were a family of 5 adults, having two rooms: 114 - Executive double, and 126 - triple. The previous reviews, basically, cover everything can be said regarding the location, the hotel, the rooms. etc. Our experience was excellent. It is all about the staff. We made our reservation more than 2 month, directly with the hotel. Ms. Reluca Vasile, was very helpful and cooperative all the way, helping with changes done even 2 days before check-in. Every thing we asked for the rooms (type, location, amnesties etc.) fulfilled as promised. The visit to London was to celebrate our daughter's 18th birthday. We asked if we can ask for some simple ""happy birthday"" decoration. We immediately approached by Melanie, from the front desk. after 2 short mails, she came back to us with a 10 pounds budget, and we agreed. while entering the room it was a very pleasant surprise for her. The room was decorated with balloons, banners etc. (I'll try to add a picture). The hotel also sent us, complimentary, two bottles of sparkling wine to celebrate, which was a surprise for us. Melanie took care of it all with willingness. The front desk people, all have been very polite and helpful. The same with the breakfast people. Maybe it was due to the time we stayed, but we did not have any problem of queues, cold things, shortage or anything like that. The only problem we had was very bad WIFI in room 114. When we complained, the sent a technical guy to check and after his check he brought a local router to the room which solve the problem and we hade very good WIFI connection. In order to be honest, there are some things that are not getting 5*: 1. The stairs to the entrance and the fact there is no bell boy. The same with no help taking the luggage to the rooms. 2. At breakfast, which was very good full cooked English breakfast +, the hotel charge extra for everything that is an ""upgraded"" espresso (like capuchin etc.). 3. The bathroom size - the bathroom is very good with its amnesties, and under floor heating. The walk in shower is very good and comfortable, but the free space in the room is tiny. only for the door to move, and this is the place for you in front of the basin. 4.In the rooms we hade a mini tablet. It is missing the browsing option outside the hotel site. No need to explain why it is needed. To conclude - Very good hotel.","en"

"1280",4,"I stayed 7 days at the hotel. No doubt, the location is perfect for food, supplies and transport. However, the service is horrible. I was given a room at 4th floor and during my stay the lift wasnt going to 4th floor. Just imagine everytime I have to go to some other floor to catch the lift with all my baby's push chair and bags. The breakfast was very basic and whole hotel was conjusted. I honestly dont recommend the hotel as Im not happy at all.","en"
"1281",3,"Stayed here the weekend just gone for 1 night. Had a bit of grief on the phone prior to staying and was given an upgrade from a Queen room to a 'King Deluxe'. Fantastic, I thought! Oh my, if I had paid for that 'King Deluxe' room I would've asked for my money back. Small room, very small bathroom, was clean and tidy but just lacked any sort of major decor and in places needed a bit of TLC. It certainly wasn't King, nor deluxe, and that's comparing it to a Queen room at the Double Tree Tower Bridge which is excellent, so I don't know what's happened here. Going to and from the hotel requires a short ride via boat which runs every 10 minutes. That's fine and is free. I'd stay again if I had to, but I'd opt for another Hilton if I could...","en"
"1282",4,"Stayed here in April 2008 for two weeks with colleagues on a business trip and chose this hotel as the location was convenient for business. Hotel is very clean, in a good location as its a five minutes walk from Canary Wharf, and a few minutes from West India Quay, LDR. The staff are courteous, friendly and very helpful, however, during the course of my stay there were continuous ""cock ups"" primarily with the room service. The bread was rock hard (for which they gave me free bottle of wine), the food took an hour etc etc. Other colleagues had issues with door keys not working, alarms setting off in the middle of the night amongst other things. Had room service a good few times, and the quality of food was good, but didnt really present value for money. Also, if you dont like fish then you are out of luck as this is what the hotel specialises in, as it is able to get fresh fish each day from Billingsgate Market a short distance away. Finally the room was smaller than expected, internet expensive to use, and if you had a room adjacent to the DLR you were in for a noisy early morning. We paid over £200 per night for this and Im sure we could have got better. Thats not to say I wouldnt stay here again.","en"
"1283",4,"Great property with SUPERB staff. Kudos go out to all those staff working at the reception. I arrived at 8am on a cold bleery Saturday.

Within 5 mins I was in my room ! What a delight after having traveled for 15 hours. Didn't try the breakfast as corporate rate didn't cover that. Gym is functional with new equipments but on a small side ( 3 threadmill, 2 elliptical, 1 bicycle). On a busy work week morning (5:30am - 7am), it does get a little bit crowded. Great staff and will I stay here again? You bet. Literally less than 5 min walk from Tower Hill Tube","en"

"1285",5,"It is still a great hotel in a great location. However, the bar scene is no longer what it was, and the F&B service was well below par (with the exception of the purple bar). Dining options are extremely limited, perhaps encouraging guests to enjoy plentiful nearby facilities. Breakfast service, while offering excellent choice, was far too slow and understaffed to be viable for a business traveller. If this sounds like a bit of a negative review for four stars, then maybe I ought also to mention the exceptional, charming and helpful reception staff, the efficient and friendly door staff and the thoughtful staff in the purple bar. The gym was also extremely well stocked and at the time of visiting (6am) completely empty.","en"
"1286",4,"This was ideally located for my business at London University and for central London sights. My single room was small, with too much furniture, so the chair had to be moved to access the wardrobe. It was clean, reasonably comfortable and all the necessities were provided. There was reasonable soundproofing with the secondary glazing. A few small niggles- e.g out of date milk on the beverage tray on two occasions, and a shower knob that was impossible to turn when wet. The free wifi also kept disappearing. Cooked breakfast was available and the staff were friendly. Not spacious or luxurious, but a reasonable standard of hotel for the price.","en"
"1287",5,"We arrived in early September when the Paralympics was in full swing, consequently the hotel was extremely busy and probably fully booked. Despite this, leaving luggage and checking in and out was efficient and friendly, and the whole atmosphere was of thoroughness and speed. The hotel is also only 2 - 3 minutes walk from Tower Hill tube station, making access to all of London quick and easy. The room was nice, with every amenity you would need, and a great view over towards tower bridge and the Thames. The room was very comfortable, and big enough for two without being generously sized. We had a minor issue with the air conditioning, the control panel was by the bed in our room, and has quite bright lights which can cause irritation if you are not accustomed to it. Otherwise, highly recommended.","en"
"1288",2,"It was the 3rd time I went there and I can say I'll try to find another hotel next time. This hotel has been left to time, as no refurbishment has taken place over the years. The main reason i've chosen it so many times is the location, as it is in a business/stylish area, with access to the newest underground line. However clean the rooms are, the time has left its marks. I can't expect a room of 284 GBP rate (indicated at the reception) to have this kind of facilities. Please bear in mind that i stayed in two different rooms, due to a short trip i had and both rooms where in the same bad condition. If you expect Internet connection, you should a take a pair of slippers, as you should visit the lounge room (next to reception) to connect in the wifi network. There is no wire broandband connection, only wifi, which doesn't work properly. I can admit that the hotel has a top classic decoration and great view (to a Thames branch river and O2), however, I'm not sure whether you will find this view again after mid 2009, or 2010, as a new building will be built very very close to the east side of the hotel (see more on www.ballymore.co.uk). Some photos of the horrible bathroom and main room conditions, as well as of the great decoration and view, here: http://img23.imageshack.us/img23/6274/britannia.jpg I almost forgot: get a portable heater with you, heating is set to Alaska temperature levels.","en"
"1289",5,"I stayed only 1 night at The Academy which was not enough. What a lovely and charming little hotel. I felt like I had found a real gem. I prefer smaller, more intimate hotels and this one really fit the bill. Beautiful and welcoming reception area and cozy relaxing rooms. I was lucky to be given a top floor room at the back overlooking the garden courtyard. I would ask for this location again. Terrific neighbourhood as well. Near the British Museum, shopping, restaurants and Tube stations. When I return to London I would not bother to look for another hotel......I would stay again at The Academy.","en"
"1290",5,"Stayed at the Rubens for our pre Christmas weekend break. Arrived just after 11 am on the Friday and both rooms were ready. Comfortable well furnished if a little small, but that's not a surprise in London. Bathroom well supported with copious hot water and great water pressure. Breakfast well recommended. We managed to get an afternoon tea reservation through the Concierge despite previous enquiries earlier in the week to the hotel that advised us afternoon tea was fully booked on Saturday afternoon. On the expensive side but definitely well worth it if one fancies afternoon tea. Word of warning, drinks in the bar are expensive !! But one can always pop across the road to the local pub. Staff in all departments can't do enough for the guests and special mention to Maisy Gale and those on the Reception Desk.","en"
"1291",4,"Myself and my husband stayed at the Beauchamp for just 1 night on Sunday 5th May. Location is lovely (we have stayed in this area before). We were given a complimentary upgrade to a Double Executive Room. I had requested a room overlooking the gardens and that is what we got - the room was very large with wonderful views across the garden. Everything was in excellent shape, nice and clean and the bed was really comfy! The room was so quiet and peaceful, had a great nights sleep! Staff at the hotel were friendly and helpful. They also have a PC set up in reception and you can access the internet here free of charge. I must admit when we visit London we dont spend a lot of time in the hotel as too much to explore outside. I dont think the Beauchamp had a bar as such, however, I did see people relaxing in the reception/lounge with a drink. The breakfast room overlooking the garden was nice, however, to be perfectly honest the continental breakfast was mediocre. However, considering what we paid for the room, overall we were very pleased with our stay. I would definitely stay again, however perhaps next time we will skip the breakfast and eat out as there are plenty of dining options very close by.","en"
"1292",3,"Nice, modern hotel in great location (albeit on busy road) in North London. Small walk from Finchley Road tube on the Jubilee Line. Sainsburys, bars, shops, chain restaurants over the road. Rooms are standard Hiexpress quality, small bar downstairs and self-service buffet breakfast. Be warned - during my stay there was NO internet, telephone or movies! This seems to be a common theme on this thread. Didn't get my free newspaper due to a mix-up and staff were lazy, lazy, lazy. Don't expect any level of courtesy or service. Hotel manager wasn't even in during my entire stay so nobody to complain at. Only stay here if you're paying low rates.","en"
"1293",5,"My wife and I stayed here for 2 nights over the bank holiday as the last fling of our honeymoon and we were not disappointed! To start with the location is fabulous (most of Londons major attractions are within walking distance) and tube stations are close by so you can get further afield. The building is both stunning and imposing on the inside and out, the rooms just continue that feeling. We stayed in a deluxe double overlooking the Thames and found the room to be very well appointed and a good size, the little touches such as the I pod player with bathroom & bedroom speakers and the caffetiere made it feel even more special. The star of the room though is the bed! Super comfortable with sumptuous pillows and beautiful Egyptian cotton sheets, we both slept fantastically!! Room service was always prompt and always quicker than they said!! We spent an evening in the Equus bar on the Sunday and enjoyed the 5 item tapas selection immensely, the service was polite and never intrusive. All in all if you want a true 5 star hotel experience that delivers on every level then The Royal Horseguards should be your first port of call!","en"
"1294",4,"Stayed 3 nights Dec 31st to 3rd Jan 2008 and what excellent value for the New Year in London. Staff were extremely helpful and friendly and checking in was a breeze. The room and bathroom was small but not too bad - it had everything we needed. Fridge had real milk and there was a good selction of quality beverages and biscuits. Iron & board and a powerful hairdryer were included as was a decent size safe. Bathroom had White Company goods and they were restocked eacjhday along with large fluffy towels. There was a CD and DVD Player with complimentary use of music and film library. We booked the VIP room which was well worth the small extra fee - we got a basket of fruit on arrival, large bottle of mineral water each day, maid service twice per day, 2 newspapers and best of all 2 vouchers each day of the stay worth £9.75 each towards drinks in the Millbank Lounge - we treat ourselves to 2 nice cocktails each night before going out. The public areas were lovely, very modern and spacious. The Millbank Lounge is lit by candles and has great little private booths that you can reserve. We didn't eat at the City Cafe Restaurant but it looked really nice - meals specials at quieter times of the year are about £17.50 for 3 courses (not at New Year though). The area is Westminster and short walks bring you to the Lambeth Bridge and Big Ben and Houses of Parliament - its lovely at night and felt quite safe as there were lots of policemen in this area because of security. Two tube stations but nearest is probably Pimlico about a good 5 minutes walk to the hotel but goes direct from Euston Station. You do have to leave immediate area to get to restaurants but there was a lovely Pizza Express on the corner of the City Inn Hotel - more upmarket than most PE I have seen - food was good and the wine is reasonable for London (£3 glass) and it had some very good wine on the menu. Staff were excellent too. Two final points - the NY Fireworks were spectacular and well worth a visit, but wrap up warm as you have to get onto the embankment by about 9pm so its a long wait - but atmosphere good and musci palying to keep the crowd happy. if you want food bring your own because there was only one place close selling food and the queues wer a mile long (no hamburger/hotdog sellers were there). Toilet queues were also long. NY Day has a huge parade which is well worth seeing as well. Avoid Restaurant chain Grand India 1 & 2 near Trafalar Square - food is awful, staff is even worse. We got ripped off big time and the waiters were like salesmen trying to bump up what you order but were not interested after that. Any queries about London - just ask?","en"
"1295",3,"I scoured reviews trying to determine the best possible Marriott hotel in London for my family of four. Based on very positive reviews here (Ritz like quality!) I booked this hotel using Marriott points (45k per night)+ cash (£400) for a Junior Suite. 2 days before we arrived I received notice that we had been upgraded to a Premier Executive Suite. I emailed the hotel in advance requesting an early check in as we were traveling with 2 younger children. Upon arrival at noon, we were told that our room would not be a premier suite, nor would we be able to check in early. Early check in - understandable, the suite downgrade? So disappointing. No upgrades were available. We were not greeted as platinum members, nor were we offered platinum amenities. At 3:30 (after waiting in the Exec lounge) I went to the front desk to inquire about our room. It was ready, they had failed to notify us, as promised. Upon arrival to our room we found the sofa intact, not made up as the sleeper as requested. Nor were there any additional sheets, blankets or pillows anywhere in the room. Another trip to the front desk promised an immediate blanket and pillow. 45 minutes later, nothing. Another trip to the front desk with blank apologies. ""We understand that you're tired"" not, ""we're sorry to have inconvenienced you!"" Finally a blanket and pillow arrived. Before we left for dinner we asked that the sofa bed be made up for the children. When we returned it was pulled out, with a single pillow and single blanket. No top sheet, only one light fleece blanket and one pillow for both children. Another call... Another 45 min for a second pillow and another light fleece blanket. The next day when I was taking a shower, water suddenly started pouring from the ceiling! Another call... The a/c condenser broke. Meanwhile, no apologies. The Exec lounge is crowded with poor offerings. US lounges are superior (and that is saying something). I wouldn't count on it for light meal offerings. It also becomes a gathering spot for large groups who often took over the entire lounge. The pool is lovely? That's the one redeeming item that I can offer about this hotel. The hotel staff certainly aren't gracious and are NO means Ritz trained. The bed is too firm and has a horrid slant. The lighting situation is impossible to figure out. Overall, far from perfect. Or frankly even good. Save your points, and your cash and stay somewhere else. You'll thank me.","en"
"1296",3,"Having stayed at the Royal National's sister hotels before, we opted for the Royal National due to it's location. The hotel itself is in an ideal spot as it is a short walk from Russell Square tube station and also around a 10-15 minute walk from Kings Cross Station. The Royal Nation is basic and in need of a facelift, however is an purse friendly option for those who are just looking for a room for a couple of nights. We had included breakfast as part of our booking, however we were welcomed with bland, tasteless cereal and lukewarm toast and decided not to return for the remainder of our stay. As part of our booking we also received a meal voucher where we were entitled to a meal for 2 at a number of partner restaurants. Whilst we decided to eat in Central London itself, this is a good deal which offers choice at a number of spots close to the hotel for those who do not want to venture too far on your first night. Staff at the hotel were polite and friendly and helpful with any request that we had. I would not immediately jump to stay at this hotel again, however the price reflects the standards provided and for a bed for the night (or two!) it's not all bad!","en"
"1297",1,"Three stars??? I really can't see how it got any at all, never mind three. Even describing this establishment as a hotel is stretching the English language beyond its limit and certainly does no justice to all those REAL hotels out there. Stayed here over three nights last month - myself, my wife and our three children (two of them teenagers). I waited a couple of weeks before writing this review because I needed that time to cool down a bit before writing. We booked this place directly with the hotel because it was unclear whether they would accommodate 5 people in a family room. We were assured verbally on the phone that 5 people would not be a problem. Well it wasn't a problem until we got there and tried to check in - we almost had to beg to get them to put an extra bed in the room. Ahhh... the room!!! What a horrible smelly hole in the ground of a room it was. Even without the extra bed in there, you could hardly walk around the beds, though in hindsight, perhaps this was a blessing insofar as it minimized contact with the dirty, dreary carpet on the floor. We were only staying three days so we didn't have too much luggage with us but we still had to ""live out of our suitcases"" - there was not enough space/storage to facilitate complete unpacking of our one suitcase and a few small bags! This was a disappointing start to our city break. Never mind - we'll go out, get something to eat, walk the streets of London and we won't have to be back here 'til late. Well, we got back later that night and decided to go to the bar to get some quick snacks and drinks. Now, where could they possibly have put it? Aw no, No bar, No restaurant, No Snacks - Nothing! Back to our little hole in the ground - we squinted as we tried to watch a tiny 14-inch TV with only about 5 TV Stations to choose from. The beds were reasonably comfortable and the sheets were clean, but the blankets didn't smell too fresh. We were woken bright and early next morning by the staff starting their work shift just before 0700. They made quite a loud racket pushing containers and vacuum cleaners around and chatting and laughing so loudly. This turned out to be a daily ritual, and each day it continued for well over an hour. Did I mention the en suite bathroom? Indeed, we had a toilet and shower en-suite, but if you didn't enter the en suite at the correct angle, turning around or manoevering after you were in there was really quite difficult (and I'm not a large person at a mere 176cm/74kg). Oh yes, the shower... the wimpy little dribbly trickle of water that emanated from the shower-head was really quite pathetic - but apart from the discomfort factor of limited water and space, all of us taking a shower took probably three or four times longer than it should have, thereby wasting our valuable sightseeing time. There wasn't even room in there for a shelf over the wash-hand basin on which to keep toothbrushes, razor, etc - they were safely packed back into our bags after each use!! It's breakfast time - We made our way to the breakfast room. One of the walls had a floor-to-ceiling, wall-to-wall fish tank - this was really gross - the fish were large and ugly; fighting among themselves over bits of gunk in the water, and the tank's murky water looked like it could have come from the Thames itself!. Anyway, we're all very hungry and continental breakfast is complimentary. Well, when I saw it I knew why! The coffee was not freshly brewed - more like a cheap instant coffee from the 70's; the toast was cold and limp and rubbery - so rubbery in fact that I could not bite through it without gnashing. Some bits of ""meat"" and cheese on a plate were also provided but these too proved to be completely inedible to us. Looking through to the kitchens, I could see a team of people washing dishes in the large sink and drying them - manually!! They didn't even have a dishwasher. By the way, there's a Garfunkels just down the road - they do proper, tasty food and service with a smile. Incidentally, this so-called hotel has no pool, no leisure facilities, no lounge, no security on the baggage room (they lend you the key and you have unmonitored, unaccompanied access to everyone's bags!) no air-conditioning, no shampoo or shower gel in the bathroom (they did provide toilet paper though), no porter to assist with bags, the slowest elevator in the world (I used the stairs with my bags after waiting for 5 minutes), and absolutely nothing to recommend it. I will not darken their door with my presence ever again - not if I was paid to. Frankly, a park bench in nearby Hyde Park is more appealing. If visiting London means you have to stay here; just stay at home - it's simply not worth it.","en"
"1298",2,"Had a rather poor experience at no11 contrary to good reports. Although the hotel is being refurbished I wasn't impressed with the results so far as I preferred the way it was. The room we were given was horrendous relating to noise levels. I had to complain about the tv next door at 2am as you could hear every word and the toilet flush was at jet decibel level ,no refrigerator and a faux wardrobe with a curtain. Really not up to 5star level and can't say I would be enticed to go back. It's a shame as the staff were friendly and helpful.","en"
"1299",4,"We stayed 4 nights at the hotel over the weekend of the Queens 90th Birthday celebrations and also my birthday. The hotel management left a gift of chocolates and champagne in our room which was a lovely surprise. Our room was very clean, the bed and pillows comfortable and staff courteous and helpful. Location, location, location - we were able to walk to all the major attractions and were in the midst of the theatre area. We were glad that we took up the recommendation of our daughter who stayed at this hotel last November.","en"
"1300",1,"I booked a room at The Millennium at Chelsea Football Club and came to the Hotel at 6am, hoping for an early check-in. Firstly, the staff were friendly and helpful saying that the hotel was currently fully booked and as soon as a guest checked out the room would be cleaned and I could check-in. Whilst waiting in reception I saw many guests checking out. Then I was told that Housekeeping didn't arrive until 7AM, then I was told 8.30AM, then 9AM and then between 9-10AM. I was promised an early check-in, and that the room would be ready between 9-9.15AM. At 8.45AM I was told that the cleaner was in the room, and this went on until 10AM. At 10AM I was told that ""maybe the room has been cleaned but not inspected"" and ""maybe we are keeping rooms available for guests that may have paid from the previous night"" and then the promise of the early check-in was removed and I was just told 2PM. The Front of House manager Chiara Vierchowod could not have been any more rude, patronising and argumentative if she tried. I then contacted the General Manager's PA, who seemed helpful which was great but constantly quoted me hotel policy without regarding the broken promises the hotel had made to me. And then knowing I had been waiting since 6AM it still wasn't deemed to just have my room checked over so I could check-in - instead giving me every possible reason why this couldn't happen until 2PM. This is no way to treat a customer, as all was needed was a room to be cleaned that was checked out and made available after being promised.","en"
"1301",4,"Trendy hotel with good service and amenities. Reception was a little small and pokey but I was treated well on my arrival and even given a warm cookie!! nice touch. Rooms have great bathrooms. Comfy beds and a nice big TV on wall. A/C cooled room down nicely. WiFi log in was problematic and all a bit annoying; not at all simple and you only get a certain amount of time free and then it's chargeable. Why some Hotels still feel the need to charge for what i consider to be an essential facility is beyond me; it's the most annoying thing when your on business and need to log on. The Cafe style restaurant was Ok but I found it a little pricey; the service was impersonal and slow. Trendy burger was had served on a wooden platter with chips in a metal mug..all very retro...tasty though. All in all a good nigh stay was had, no complaints.","en"

"1303",5,"I have just returned back home and could not wait to publicly say a big thank you to Rachel and all of the staff at Premier Inn London Waterloo. On arrival at the hotel the reception staff were very polite and helpful. Checking in was a pleasure. We had a lovely family room with impressive views which would have cost a lot more money in other hotel. (Views of Big Ben, Parliment and London Eye) There were the usual tea and coffee facilities, hairdryer, toiletries, extra pillows and comfy beds. Also the staff went out of their way to buy my sons chocolates and a card for their birthday and put the muffin basket in our room which I had had delivered to our hotel. We opted to have dinner in the hotel on night one. The staff were very helpful and friendly, but there were a still a few teething problems due to the newness of the hotel. Our waitress forgot to order our food and only realised after 45 minutes. When the food did arrive it was OK, nothing special. The staff also need to learn to clear tables quicker than they were doing. Trying to eat your main course with lots of glasses on the table is never easy. However, next morning it was a different story. Breakfast was lovely and very well cooked. My sons are very healthy, hearty eaters and their needs were well catered for. The staff were very nice and each morning went out of their way to ask us, if we had had a good nights sleep, what had we done and what we were going to do, and our comments about breakfast. As other reviews mentioned before breakfast could be caotic, but if guests follow the natural flow of the restaurant and use the other beverage / cereal points there should never be a problem Housekeeping were very good and our room was always clean and the coffee tray was always replenished. Check out was very easy and the receptionist again very pleasant and professional. This particular premier inn may be a little bit more expensive than others, but it is in a great location and it as fantastic people working at it. Would I stay here again - Yes without a doubt and thats even without the great views. Again thank you to everyone and especially to Rachel who went out of her way to accommodate my requests.","en"

We checked in, the room was not ready, because we arrive early, but we have booked club access, so we sat in there enjoying the exceptional good service. The junior suite and room was very nice. And they even came to the room with juice, fruit and cookies for our kids and a super sweet handwritten card!:) They also came up with 2 goodie bags with toys for our kids. And during kids club they arranged a birthday party for our son. Everything free of charge. Very fresh and modern little gym. The location is surb.

"1311",4,"We stayed for two nights in this hotel, we had one of the themed Royal Rooms. It was well appointed but small, but very comfortable, clean and well maintained. I think if we had had to stay longer a bigger room would have been required. But it was very adequate for our needs. The staff were excellent, friendly, attentive and made you feel genuinely welcome! If you have any travel inquiries or need directions the concierge is the place to go to - they were extremely knowledgeable and helpful. There is a good bar with interesting military decor worth a close look. The food was good and the drinks reasonably priced. But the location is outstanding. a few minutes walk to Victoria Station for Tube access and British rail services. Then of course you have Buckingham Palace, St James's Park at your doorstep. And a good stroll takes you to Harrods. Just a few minor points, the lift is small (four people at a time - although its cosy and a great way of meeting people, we did manage to get seven in it minus luggage!!) and the shower screen doesn't quite stop the water splashing onto the floor when you shower, so be careful when stepping out of the 'over the bath' shower. Overall, loved it!. Thanks Rubens for making our short stay so enjoyable.","en"

But this area appears to be recently developed and there isn't much in the immediate vicinity. We needed to take a taxi or uber to better pubs or restaurants. It was also a close enough area to take a quick inexpensive ride to Wimbledon. I do recommend it but don't expect any nearby nightlife.","en"

The hotel overall is very nice, I did not get a chance to try out the breakfast but I sure it was of excellent quality. The room was very quite.

"1323",4,"It was a work related trip and we didn't check in until just before 11pm. We needed something to eat and this was where we all encountered the first problem. We had heard that the restaurant was quite good but were told that last orders were taken at 10:30. Apparently the room service menu was available so we decided to order from that - only to be told that we could only order room service from the room! We all tried, in various different ways, to point out that we were happy to pay a surcharge - we just wanted food - and wasn't it just a teensy bit jobs worth to not let us just order it from the bar?! It took us a good few minutes to get there - we ordered a range f food - only to then be told that the chicken wings were off! To be fair, we got there in the end and weren't charged the room service fee but the waiter did seem incapable of understanding the basic concept of keeping the customer happy and wanted to stick to his ""rules"" By contrast - way past midnight - I headed for my room and my heart sank. As I have got nearer pension age (still few years off!) I have noticed an increased tendency for hotels to put me in the room with disabled facilities! I am not crook yet!! So, as i checked out the bathroom and noticed the plastic chair in the shower and the lack of a bath my mood was not good. I am glad to say that when I rang reception they immediately moved me to a room with a bath. So, that was good service but shouldn't they check this sort of thing out before they check you in? A colleague was less than happy because she could not order room service fir breakfast and pay the surcharge. In itself this is not the end of the world but the two examples cited just show how an otherwise nice hotel, in a pleasant location, can be let down by rigid adherence to a fairly arbitrary set of rules.","en"

Rooms vary from adequate in size, to huge but ALL are exceptionally comfortable and very quiet.

We had a handicap room, this is a big room to stay in, but i would prefer to stay in a 'normal' room because we did not had a normal shower, not a cabine or something, but the whole badroom was the shower. Not so enjoyable to stay in. And also, the room had a verry bad smell, there was clearly something wrong with the drains, did not understand that the maids didnt smell it. The room had all the basics, tv, koffie and thee. The breakfast was not bad, simpel and basic, little bit tired of it after 4 days. The fruit on the other hand was not oke.

She was a real credit to the hotel. The room was basic as you'd expect but functional and in the modern Travelodge style. A kettle with sachets was provided along with hangers for limited clothes storage and enough empty sockets for phone charging. We didn't use the WiFi or dine at the hotel but from looking at the menu there are a range of inexpensive dishes on offer to cater for most tastes. With the 2012 investment in the area, as expected the location is great and very useful for travelling, with DLR, bus, tube and train links all within 5/10 minutes walking distance as is Westfield Stratford with it's multitude of retail and dining options!

(barely room to open two suitcases on the floor) This small niggle aside, the room was really very nice, clean and had every luxury you would expect. Location wise this hotel is great if you're planning on exploring the Greenwich area and slightly inconvenient if you want to go to central London. A DLR stop is about a 3 minutes walk, so that's not too bad, but it does take about 30 minutes to get anywhere central, since Greenwich is a bit outside of the center.","en"

The location is great, on a quiet side-street, and we walked into Greenwich and visited the Cutty Sark, Maritime Museum and Greenwich Market. The staff were friendly and helpful - highly recommended.","en"

"1346",3,"Despite being able to see Kings Cross Station this hotel faces Argyle Square, a quiet haven. The welcome on arrival was warm and friendly and despite seeing other reports of dirty carpets and the like I found the place spotless. The rooms are compact but for an overnight stay at these prices it provided all I needed, including more than enough tea / coffee. I am 6'4"" but the single bed was comfy and I had a good nights sleep. The breakfast is serve yourself buffet, again adding to the value for money, with friendly waitresses serving hot drinks. Whe you add the fact that you get free WiFi this hotel provides excellent value for money on the doorstep of Kings Cross. If you are looking for a good lunch / dinner see the notices in the rooms for Karpa, just round the corner.","en"
"1347",5,"Right in the center of Soho and close to everything, this very unique hotel is ideal for the alternative traveler. Get a larger room which has a kitchenette space and you will not regret it. For gay travelers, it is very much in the area of bars and restaurants off of Compton.

"1350",5,"The Grange Tower Bridge Hotel is a new 5 star property very close to Tower Bridge London. I stayed in this hotel in July 2014 while on a business trip. My work location, the Gherkin, was a few minutes walk from the place which was really convenient. The hotel is a smart and modern spanking clean. The rooms are decently sized with a double bed and all the works including a desk for office work. The break fast in the hotel is served in a large restaurant and all the usual continental fare is server here. Since I was on a short trip, I did not get a chance to explore the various facilities that the hotel provides. However, I was impressed by the general ambiance, the courteous staff and the efficiency in the Hotel. Tower Bridge London can easily be reached on foot from this hotel. The business district of More London is also at a walkable distance","en"

We booked the hotel quite a while ago and it worked out at just under £400 for the 3 of us for 4 nights with breakfast. Amazing value in my opinion. The hotel is a 5 minute walk from the train station but it is very quiet and we welcomed the peace after sight seeing and battling crowds all day. We stayed on the first floor but were not troubled with noise at all. Rooms were serviced every day, staff were very helpful and welcoming. Breakfast was decent value for money with a very good selection offered. We will certainly be back and I will be recommending this one to my friends.","en"

Tea = £6 + £3 'optional' service charge Water = small bottle £4 large bottle £7.50 Got a large bottle of champagne as there were no half bottles left, not bad at all. Over all a very pleasant stay, right on top of the West India Quay DLR station which might I add is no distraction when sleeping at all. Would recommend for shorter stays, took about 20 minutes to get to Leicester Square so not too far for tourists but probably best for business travelers. NB room service was VERY slow and the receptionist found it shocking that I expected it to have arrived after 30 minutes of waiting haha, very rude. Oh well some people are just ....

"1355",4,"I have a long history with this hotel. It's always been my first choice in London whenever I'm there (about 2-3 times a year), but my last stay changed my impression completely. I stayed there for about 2 weeks in winter 2012 and a month in summer, and 6 nights with my partner in January 2014 for a New Year's getaway. There's no denying that the location of this hotel is definitely great. It's within walking distance from all major attractions; Leicester Square, Oxford Street, Soho and very accessible through major tube stations (Tottenham Court Road station is 3 mins away). The rooms are nicely decorated and very cozy. Very comfortable beds and luxurious bathrooms. However, the service of the hotel is probably the worst I've ever experienced for what I pay - especially the reception staff. On all my stays, the credit card machine doesn't seem to work properly. First incident - Summer 2012: When I had to check out from my 28 night stay in Summer 2012, and after paying a huge bill for the room and in-room dining, there was a problem with my credit card as did not accept any transactions. On my way out, the bill was being settled but the credit card did not seem to work. There was about 120 pounds (out of 4500+ pounds that was already settled) that the card did not accept to process. I explained to the receptionist that my flight is in 2 hours and my friend is staying in the room for the night as I have already paid for it and he'd be happy to settle the rest of the payment. I was basically shouted at by the receptionist saying ""WE WANT THE MONEY NOW!, I'VE BEEN TRYING TO PROCESS YOUR CARD ALL DAY BUT IT'S NOT WORKING"". As my friend was sleeping in the room, I had to call my family to send their credit card details to pay the remaining amount. Again, the system did not accept the payment and I was blamed. Thankfully, the problem was in the hotel's payment system. Another issue I faced during that trip is that they blocked the full amount of my stay on my credit card and did not release it until 2 weeks after I've checked out, which probably caused the whole problem. Also, my GHA account (the loyalty program) was only credited for 10 nights, not the whole stay. Second incident - January 2014: This experience at this hotel has paled in comparison with the other hotels in the Group (the Marylebone). As a platinum GHA member, I did not feel very special upon check-in. Although the check-in staff were delightful, especially, Joelle, we were disappointed by a number of things not least the way in which the night manager seemed to dismiss our regular stays at GHA hotels for over 30 nights a year as relatively insignificant as compared with others who stay for months at a time. What we sought was a way to upgrade our room to a deluxe by paying extra and a complimentary upgrade to a suite by way of benefit from the platinum membership. But instead we were shown a series of extremely small deluxe rooms only one of which had the desired kingsize bed. Having travelled for a long time, we settled for the room (that looks like a renovated attic) in order to rest only to find these things lacking: - Hairs on the sheets of the bed behind the pillows - No complimentary water - No kettle - No answer (just answerphone) from room service by telephone after having tried 5 times to reach them between 10pm and 1130pm - No shower gel or conditioner in the room - Not having been asked on check-in whether we wanted a newspaper - A malfunctioning ipod dock with no cable - A malfunctioning bedside reading lamp - A malfunctioning nespresso machine After emailing the day manager with our complaint, we received a call on 4th night (out of 6) offering us a different room. However, we didn't want to go through the trouble of packing and unpacking for a 48 hour stay. In conclusion, I'd recommend this hotel for ""in and out"" stays of 3-4 nights. It's nicely decorated and clean, but don't expect any special treatment or 5-star service for the overpriced rooms compared to its neighbours like the Radisson Edwardian.","en"
"1356",4,"This hotel has a lot going for it. Decent price for London, great location near the Kings Cross/St. Pancras station, nice staff, comfy (but small) room, good restaurants attached.

"1357",5,"We traded in a lot of Marriott points to stay in The Grosvenor Hotel. My 60th birthday trip and we thought why not treat ourselves. The staff greeting you are as you expect .. top notch and very professional. I won't say I was very happy when I had to cool my jets because my partner was returning the rental car and my last name is different from his and even though I was holding the reservation confirmation..they wouldn't accept it from me. Finally showing copies of our passports seemed to do the trick and I was finally take up to our room. Our room was a bit of a walk from the elevator banks, but nothing too terrible. The room was lovely, with massive closet space and a sizable bathroom. Well appointed with hefty large towels, bathrobes, all the things one would require. The bed was extremely comfortable and all linens fresh and just perfect in every way. After being on the road for 12 days, this was the first opportunity we had to unpack and actually relax. This was a great way to do it! The hotel in terms of service is precisely what you expect. Nothing is too much trouble. I was in a bit of culture shock over the cost of everything in this hotel..but I probably shouldn't have been considering its reputation and the level of hotel. We only visited the Starbucks downstairs for coffee..never using the restaurant facilities. I like posh..but also missed the joy of small cafes and little nook lunch spots. None of those really can be found around this establishment..you have to walk. And speaking of walking..it's not a great location if you are a believer in tube stations. It falls smack in between two stations...making it quite a walk to access them. No matter..needed to loose some weight anyway! However what warmed them to me...was the ever present service and going the extra mile. Coming home we found a bottle of wine on the desk...clearly left as a gift for my birthday. Such a surprise and very much appreciated. One small complaint...the wifi was extremely slow. For a hotel with this reputation..that really surprised me. Bottom line..if you can afford it...experience this property at least once in your life!","en"
"1358",5,"Stayed with friends for a weekend theatre trip. Great little hotel, good price for central London. We had a premier twin, room was very clean and spacious. As it was the weekend it was very quiet, even slept with the window open as room was very hot! Hotel staff very welcoming and helpful. Only downside is the distance from the tube, about 10-15 min walk to either Angel or Barbican, and not a walk we felt comfortable taking in the evening. However, only £5 for a taxi to the hotel from Angel. Would stay here again.","en"
"1359",4,"Staff are friendly and helpful, they provided me with a full length mirror as there wasn't one in the room. A bit of a must for the bridal party really. Also the room was a little dark.

Not great considering how much we paid and I got 2 hours sleep. Having said that, we did think it was a lovely hotel, steeped in history.","en"

I didnt really want to come home to be honest! We never had dinner or lunch in the hotels restaurant but breakfast was very good. Staff were helpful and pleasant.

We ordered full afternoon tea set that arrived in three tiered plates. Scones with clotted cream was flaky and delicious. As our teapots became empty, a staff provided us with fresh pot. They even offered to take pictures for us after seeing my SLR. Since I take most of the pictures, it was nice to appear in one. Very good experience.","en"
"1363",5,"We booked this for a last minute break over Easter and we can't imagine ever staying anywhere else in London. The hotel is luxurious, friendly, quirky and anything but beige. The beds were comfortable, the bed linen and towels luxurious and such a treat to have L'occitane products in the bathroom. It is the little touches that make this hotel - bars of green and blacks chocolate, their own chilli sauce, an easter egg! Along with the lounge bar where you can help yourself to tea, coffee, hot chocolate (all organic) and if you want the honesty bar! The trust they instill in their guests and their open, honest and friendly way in which they treat you makes you realise that this is a very special place run by verry special people.

"1365",3,"I stayed here on Saturday night on a Travelzoo deal. For me the positives outweighed the negatives. Positives were location - just opposite the Italian Garden in Kensington Gardens, good transport links - five mins from the tube station and bus stop, great air con - nicely cooled down the room with the vents nicely placed, quality of breakfast - loads of choice and no wait and a good wi fi connection. Negatives were the size of the room - double bed was pushed against the wall, the sound quality of the television - very tinny, the service at breakfast - one waitress completely ignored us and the other took 20 mins to bring us toast and the very small bathroom - you had to turn sideways in the bathtub to get a decent shower and the step into the bath was pretty high. The travelzoo deal was good value at £99 for bed and breakfast in a London hotel and yes I would stay here again.","en"
"1366",5,"My daughter and I stayed for one night, part of my Mother's Day/Birthday present. Complimentary upgrade was offered and very gratefully received upon arrival. Room was delightful, 2 queen sized beds, comfy chairs, coffee table, usual tea and coffee but neatly stashed away in a cupboard, good sized TV, Bose sound system, hairdryer, iron, the list goes on and on......... Comfy beds providing a good night's sleep, essential when you have been joining in the singing and dancing at the excellent Commitments show and fantastic views of Tower Bridge and the Shard. Reception, most helpful and very efficient, leave your bags here as we did, don't drag them around with you. We breakfasted at Weatherspoons also overlooking the Tower, very pleasant. We then did the Tower of London, wine in the Shard, a Thames River Cruise, National Portrait Gallery, Trafalgar Square and Leicester Square with lots of option for food and drink along the way, we really like the All Bar One chain. Hotel is a good centre for underground links, bus stops etc. Would we stay again - in a heartbeat!! Great stuff","en"
"1367",4,"There are so many hotels in London that finding one that's suit you is really difficult, especially during Rugby World Cup month! Finding the Imperial Hotel, with rooms in our budget range, was a stroke of luck. Our first impression was that the reception staff were polite, courteous and helpful, checking us in very quickly, and giving all of the information we needed. The room was large, warm and clean, with double sinks in the bathroom, a sofa in the lounge area, and ample space for everything. Despite the size of the hotel, and the large amount of hungry guests, breakfast was a very pleasant experience. A steward showed us to our table, the buffet breakfast we very plentiful, hot and delicious - the only downside was that tea and coffee was served one cup at a time by the waiter, and was in flasks, so was a bit weak and dreary - other than that, no complaints. The hotel,has several bars, a couple of,cafes, and a restaurant, so plenty of choice for everyone. On our check-put day we wanted to do some shopping in Oxford Street, just a short walk away, before catching our train, and the hotel offers a baggage storing service for just 50p per day, per bag, a great perk! Overall a great stay, couldn't fault it!","en"
"1368",4,"I had the unfortunate pleasure of staying here during a business trip. Having stayed in their sister hotel next door (Whitehall) earlier in the year, but found they were fully booked - I decided to stay here, thinking it would be simlar to next door, which was good value and clean - Not so. I booked an 'executive room' in the hope that it would be a suitable choice - not so. The ground floor room I was allocated was very dated, had a lumpy bed and the bathroom had mouldy walls. Clearly it had not been well maintained or updated for years - a disgrace for the price charged. I decided not to stop for breakfast based on my experience of the room. This is such a shame considering its excellent location on a wonderful street in the heart of London - they have clearly missed the boat - I would give this hotel a 2 star rating, not 4 star as suggested on some websites. I will not be returning.","en"

Used to use the Myhotel bar a couple of years ago when I lived in London and had always wanted to stay but wasn't as great as I remembered. The room was the real let down although it was ok for a business trip. Just an extremley small single room, ok I didnt expect it to be that big as it was a singe but I am a small UK size 8 and I struggled to move around the bathroom and a weird set up with the wardrobe - had to reach hand into a small gap to hang up clothes, my husband would have got his arm stuck?! Another big bug bear with me although this isnt unique to this hotel the hairdryer. Will somebody please provide a decent hairdryer in a hotel, we ladies do like to style our barnets and not just wash and go, thankfully this one did have switches not one of those awful things that you have to hold on to use, however there was no mirror in the room. Ugh so annoying!! Didnt stretch to the mirror on the door or into the bathroom. Apart from that if you need somewhere to stay that is central for around £155 per night this is an ok pick.

We were upgraded to an executive room which was fitted out to a very high standard with a large bed, dining table and a fantastic bathroom with large separate rainfall shower. It was very hot but the air conditioning worked extremely well keeping a nice cool temperature. There appeared to be a lot of staff on duty at all times who all had a smile. Breakfast was very good, again lots of staff who were very pleasant and efficient but not in your face. Because of the late check out we could freshen up in the room after our morning sight seeing in the heat.

"1393",4,"We had booked last minure as we were stranded on the day so that when we got there the travel agent hadn't sent through the booking confirmation to the hotel so this was the first test of service and it was handled well so that after a short time we were booked in. We had already been greeted outside and our luggage collected. The exterior of this hotel is magnificent as are the public areas inside so you can't help but have a good first impression. We had booked the Barlow Queen room at £275 per night and after the grandness of the reception area we were a little disappointed with the room itself. It was well presented and well equipped and had Molten Brown shampoos and shower gels etc, but the room itself was pretty bland and featureless. The bed was comfy, the shower worked well, the ironing board they supplied was broken but replaced easily. We stayed four nights and had drinks in the reception area one night. Drinks are reasonably price at about £30 for a bottle of wine. On all four nights we were there, likely because of the time of year (t was the second week in December) there were parties in the big hall by the bar, which was OK, but it meant the bar area was closed for most of the first part of the evening as a drinks reception area for the party guests so that was disappointing. Overall I would recommend this hotel for the beautiful public spaces. Plus, the location is great for transport links and the service is very friendly, professional and polite.","en"
"1394",4,"Super room (air con / heating temperature controls) & the bed was so comfortable I wanted to move in & live there (duvet, mattress topper). It's quiet & relaxing & the staff are excellent - friendly & helpful, they seemed to really care if you enjoyed your stay. I had a cold & didn't want to eat in the restaurant so they sent the meal up to our room (good food). Downside was a faulty shower experience - huge shower with rain shower head which shot out just one narrow jet of water! We had a lovely breakfast at the deli cafe (Del Azziz or something like that) on the corner near Sainsbury's. Will definitely stay here again. 188 bus from Wateloo stops close by. Fashion & Textile Museum is just up the road.","en"

"1396",4,"This hotel is in a good location albeit on one of the most congested roads in London which can be noisy. Lobby is nice and staff are just OK but that's London for you. The big disappointed is the rooms they are very tired looking and the carpets just doesn't feel clean. They have fabric covered seats in the room which once again just don't feel good. My advice would be to stay in the holiday inn directly opposite, quieter and more modern.","en"
"1397",4,"A very nice hotel. Got a room with no windows at first but we changed for another one with no problems (as there were a few available we were even offered to choose). Nice design and very clean. Breakfast included, which is a big advantage compared to other hotels which offer breakfast for 15 pounds per person. Rooms not very spacious but this is normal for London. Not in the strict centre so prices more attractive but sub nearby which will take you to the centre in 10/15min. After midnight there is a night bus which stops just in front of the hotel, it takes more time but very convenient. All in all, we had a nice stay and no unpleasant surprises.","en"

She showed us to the lounge area and then to our room, our room was lovely and the on suite bathroom was gorgeous. Alison was very friendly. pleasant and helpful. nothing was to much trouble. We was in London to watch the show We Will Rock You, and told Alison this, we asked her where the theatre was and before we knew it she had printed off a small map to show us exactly where to go. We were both very impressed with this. we had keys to door so could go back to hotel whenever we wanted. The breakfast in the morning was amazing, everything was brilliant. very impressed indeed. Would definitely go back. The only moan would be, when we went for breakfast the gentleman taking our order forgot we had asked for bacon, and we were embarrassed to ask at first, but then my husband asked for our bacon, and the man said he had forgot it or didn't hear us properly, so just a suggestion Arosfa, maybe when man is asking what guests want for cooked breakfast, maybe he should have a small note pad , therefore would avoid any mistakes or embarrassments. But would definitely go back. xxx","en"

Superb unobtrusive service, wonderful cocktails, just the place for a celebratory drink with smart surroundings. But the clientele? Now look, if I am paying top dollar for service and drinks in a quality bar, I expect a certain level of dress code, I'm not old fashioned, jacket and tie might be a little too much on an early Saturday evening, but jeans and trainers?

The hotel has friendly and courteous staff, the rooms are quite spacious and include a large sofa, the showers are good, and the breakfast is nice.

Easy to reach by tube from Heathrow airport and well communicated for our raids to London. Beds with good mattresses (essential), a clean bathroom with plenty of warm water, quiet ambiente, really a pleasure (at least room 107).

"1413",3,"Oh, what a tiny room! I've been to London about 20 times and I know from experience that rooms can be very small, but you expect a 4 star hotel to be different. Not in this case. The room was very small and I could hardly turn around in the bathroom and especially in the shower, and I'm far from being a big guy. So if you're over 1.70 meter and 70 kg - you'll have a real problem. The room was well equiped with relible wi-fi, a flat TV, a safe and coffee making facility. It faced the inner corridor, so there was no day light. I couldn't open the window and swipe the our curtain, so it wasn't very pleasant. The location is good: 2 minutes walk from Edgware Road tube station and 5 minutes walk from Paddington tube and rail station. For me it had two more advantagesL Waitmore in Edgware Road has a good kosher department and the hotel is laee that 15 minutes walk from Marble Arch Synagogue. I know that the bathroom wasn't cleaned properly: the signs of the soap in the sink remained for day one until I left five days later. The maid also didn't notice that the soap was over and I had to ask for it. I reported on the first day that the lump's switch was broken; it wasn't fixed. The staff was friendly and helpful.","en"

The staff were all very helpful and the buffet breakfast was excellent.","en"
"1415",5,"You know you are someplace special the moment you drive up to the front door. You are greeted by the front door staff and shown inside to the front desk where your pampering begins. Before I knew it, we were checked in, and were told that tea would be sent up to our room shortly! Ruel, the concierge was very accessible before we even left home to arrange several tours, and was able to confirm those when we checked in. The tours, and the restaurants he recommended during our stay were amazing! Room service was delicious, and the chef went above and beyond one night and made scones especially for my daughter and I! The room was clean and comfortable. The marble bathroom was large and had a lot of useful space to put toiletries etc. There was a towel warmer which was just above and beyond! Under no circumstances should you miss having a martini at the hotel bar or a dinner at the hotel restaurant Thirty Six. Both of these are a must for anyone's trip to London!","en"
"1416",4,"Stayed this last weekend (Sun/Mon) as we were setting up an exhibition stand at the Business Design Centre. We were right across the road from the centre so this hotel is ideal for anyone visiting or setting up an exhibition there. The hotel is new and so is spotless, the rooms are large and the beds are comfortable. Location is on the back of the main road and so is blissfully quiet! One minor quibble would be that although we got down for breakfast at 7:15am, the fried eggs and hash browns had obviously been sat under the heat lamp for too long as the hash browns tasted stale and the yolk in the egg was like rubber. If they could find a way to keep these items warm without this happening then the breakfast would be excellent - fresh fruit, Costa coffee, a selection of cereals and fruit juices - everything else was great. Angel / Islington needed this hotel and for me it has added something to the area. The mix of shops and bars and now this gem of a hotel make this one of my favourite areas of London and when I next return to visit for pleasure rather than business, I shall definitely be staying here.","en"
"1417",5,"The Dorchester is always my hotel of choice in London, the rooms are extremely comfortable and the service is reliable. I recently visited the Dorchester as I have done regularly over the last 15 years or so. However since then I have received a personal message direct to my tripadvisor identity. The message complemented me on the standard of the writing of my tripadvisor reviews and stated that I had been selected to write reviews for an exclusive internet site. However they required my personal email address so that they could send the login details of their site to me. I pointed out that revealing my personal email address to someone who I did not know would be foolhardy so they then suggested that I contact them via their email address for this purpose, (therefore there not being any improvement in my security). My people set up a ghost email address and out of curiosity I sent an email very politely offering to be involved. I have not received a reply several weeks later despite their initial reply by trip advisor messaging being immediate. Some people have suggested to me that this may allegedly be a cause for concern. The person or persons concerned selected a regular guest at the Dorchester, a hotel that is well known as the London home of some of the most wealthy, powerful, distinguished, well connected and famous people visiting London. I am writing this to inform other members of the Tripadvisor community, also those who stay at the Dorchester who don't contribute but who may read the reviews and for the information of the management of the hotel. I also hope that Tripadvisor themselves will pick up on this. In these times we all have to be ever mindful of security. The tripadvisor address the message was sent from was sarahstephens84, this member has no contributions or other entries on Tripadvisor which some people have suggested to me may allegedly indicate that they have joined in order to obtain access to members. If you receive a similar message and if you feel inclined to do so, please let me know.","en"
"1418",2,"Given the hotel is located in one of the said; posh and convenient central london neighbourhood; but fails to offer a good night's sleep for sure. The front desk clearly has no professional hospitality industry experience and/or training. The rooms are 'extremely' small (Double bed); shabby interiors & infested by flying insects. Be prepared, should you land up there in a room, to not to be surprised if you find no curtains or caught up in the draft of fresh paint smell and moreover find no towels in the bathroom. Also, rely on your mobile/watch alarms and not on the promised wake up call from the guest services.","en"
"1419",4,"Much has been written by many other contributors so I will be succinct. Good location near tube link and its apparently located in Fulham not Chelsea. Rooms acceptable at the prices they charge but they are not luxurious, it’s not a destination hotel, it’s a sleep factory but nothing wrong with that. Breakfast in the main restaurant was good- plenty of choice – fresh orange juice, coffee good, tea iffy. Shower over bath was OK but a tight fit, suggest they ditch the bath and put in a shower room! Freebies in fridge + bathroom all OK but not top end. Quiet and safe at night – and praise the Lord the windows opened for fresh air! Double bed wasn’t king size but in good order as too bedding, pillows just OK. Staff were all very polite, well trained ,helpful and they actually smile, which is rare in London hotels I’m afraid Main downers? Stains on carpet - ughhhhh £5 extra over for English over continental breakfast and they also add 12 1/2% service charge - this is petty and annoying! So OK stay – can’t complain – we got what we expected except the stain on the carpet.","en"

"1421",3,"Excellent location. The hotel is a London attraction by itself. I had booked a standard double room, breakfast not included, through Booking.com. When we arrived we were shown to room 537 which overlooked the back. It was big and welcoming. We didn't mind not having a view, we value peace and quiet more. However, right outside that room there were the monstrous exterior units of the central air-conditioning system of the hotel. There was a constant nerve-breaking buzzing noise so we immediately asked if we could change room, somewhere away from that noise. The receptionist was very courteous and he moved us to room 560. The room was huge by any standards and gorgeous but it had the exact same problem as the first one although we had explicitly explained that we wanted a room away from the exterior air-conditioning units . We asked to change again and were given room 718. Although this room was small compared to the previous two we were offered, it had an amazing view of the river Thames so we decided to settle in. Sound insulation is not one of the strong points of this hotel. Even though we were high up on the 7th floor, the noise from the street was loud and clear. I consider having a good night sleep as the most important factor when choosing a hotel and I must say that I wasn't satisfied. I expected more for the amount of money that I paid. We were lucky because we stayed there during the days of the british big freeze so traffic was sparse and we didn't suffer from continuous noise, only occasionally. Staff and service were overall very good but there was a misunderstanding upon check-out. In the beginning, we were charged extra for having had breakfast every day during our stay. When we pointed out that our package hadn't included breakfast and that we hadn't eaten any meals at the hotel, the extra amount was detracted but then the receptionist said that breakfast had been complimentary to amend for the inconvenience of moving to three different rooms. This however, had not been made clear to us so we didn't benefit from the offer. It would have been wonderful to be able to enjoy our breakfast in the hotel instead of going out every morning. Anyway, I still don't understand why we were charged for it in the first place. We were offered free breakfast for the day of our departure but we couldn't take advantage of the offer since our flight left very early in the morning and we wouldn't have time for breakfast at all.","en"
"1422",4,"We stayed here for two nights and thought its was great. The location of course is perfect as its close to the centre of London with The House's of Parliament, The London Eye and The Tate Modern all within easy walking distance. The rooms are adequate, clean, quiet and comfortable. This isn't a luxury hotel but so you shouldn't expect 5 star luxury rooms, but its still very good. We didn't eat in the hotel so it would be unfair to comment on the food. But I must mention the staff in the reception, they are a young team but all of them are extremely friendly, professional, helpful and welcoming. Congratulations need to go to Premier Inns for selecting and training such a good team. We will be back here again the next time we stay in London.","en"

All the usual ameneties,large bathrooom with seperate shower and bath. in fact there were 2 toilets in seperate parts of the room..There was a seperate dining area .There was a turn down service which was nice. Room service was good,however you do get charged £3.50 per tray although it comes up on the same trolley!! We checked in at 12.30,no problems there. The executive longe was busy during the day,however it has plenty of room at late evening. Alcoholic drinks are only allowed between 6 - 8.30 pm. Location is excellent for trains and heathrow airport. During our stay LCD flatscreen T.v's were being put into the rooms. The only little grumble was the the bedside/stand up lamps didnt work.

For our inconvenience, we were given a complimentary continental breakfast the following morning. (At first they offered 1 breakfast for 2 of us?)!! The breakfast was good with plenty of choice, but the coffee was cold. We told the waiter, and he brought us fresh drinks. We were then brought a bill for our complimentary breakfast, this was sorted out without any fuss.","en"
"1425",5,"This is one of the most dramatic and beautifully restored hotels we have ever seen. It is right in St. Pancras (Eurostar) station, across from Kings Cross Station (major train lines) and on top of about 5 subway (Tube) lines which means you can get to most places on a single line without going outside. (don't forget it does rain in London!) We were coming down on the train from Scotland, so it was great arriving across the street, rather than at Heathrow. A five minute walk got us in the door. The building has been restored from its former, abandoned, state. It is breathtaking. First class everything with attention to historical details. We had a beautiful room and service was perfect in every respect. As a frequent Marriott Elite Traveller we were treated like the Royal Couple and extended every courtesy. There are few hotels (especially in the reasonable price range) in the world as good as this place. If you are looking for a special place for a special trip, this is it. If you want a second home in London, this is it. If you are taking the Eurostar, this is it.","en"

"1427",1,"We booked this hotel online at short notice and did not read any of the reviews - BIG MISTAKE! We were given a room close to reception at the front of the hotel (room number 4) and the room seemed ok but did have a strange smell, especially the bed linen. The tag line for this hotel is ‘a good night’s sleep’ but it definitely is not! People were walking past our room all night talking loudly and at 5am there was loud singing/chanting/laughter. We finally got some sleep around 7am and woke up around 8.30am. I tried to have a shower but there was no hot water so we decided to pack our case and load up the car before heading across the hall for breakfast only to find that the breakfast room was locked. We asked at reception and were told that breakfast is only served until 9am. This was a 9.05am and both my husband and I are sure that reception had told us breakfast was served until 10am. We had paid for breakfast and I explained that we had not had any sleep because of the noise but they would not even give us any toast! We will definitely not be staying here again and would urge others to think twice before booking here, the price may seem good value but you will regret it!","en"

On arrival, we thought that the hotel didn't look too appealing from the outside but checked in anyway. We were fairly surprised to find the rooms pretty decent (similar in style to a travelodge) with an ensuite shower room and coffee making facilities (which the ability to ask for more coffee at reception). Breakfast was included in our booking and, though there wasn't a huge selection, we couldn't complain about the food itself. The location of the hotel was also pretty convenient as it's only a short walk away from Edgware Road station and there were a few pubs, fast food places and shops nearby. Overall, we had a good experience of the hotel and I'd recommend it and would book again in future.","en"
"1430",5,"I have to say I have stayed in many 5* hotels and this is probably the best so far. My favourite usual haunt when staying in London has been the Landmark however Corinthia has now replaced that. Unfortunately I only had a one night stay with my daughter, but from the evening meal, breakfast and afternoon tea to the fantastic room and oh so comfortable beds to the most relaxing Espa Thermal floor, I could not find one thing to fault. The 24 hour check-in and out time was brilliant and added that extra touch - no more rushing after breakfast to pack and get out before 12 noon and what a difference that made. I hope that I might be able to stay again for my BIG birthday and enjoy all the extra touches that this hotel offers. Whoever thought of those added 'extra's' WELL DONE because it certainly makes Corinthia stand out head and shoulders above the rest. I will certainly be using this hotel for business trips to London in future and hope to bring the rest of the family soon, as I am sure once I tell them all about the stay they will be so jealous.

The hotel is quiet but do avoid eating in the pub on a Friday evening as you can't get in the door for the weight of people enjoying their start to the weekend drink.

"1435",5,"We stayed here last year so this review is a little overdue! We stayed for four nights and wanted an affordable but well located hotel and this option came up trumps. From the simple check in to the well laid out rooms, the hotel was perfect for us. The bed was so incredibly comfortable - we slept so well! I would say that it would be good for couples and solo travellers but if you're travelling with someone you don't know so well, maybe the bathroom design could be a little offputting. it was fine for us. One morning we had breakfast at Borough Market (well worth the visit) but we also ate in the hotel. The selection was nice and there were plenty of tables. The bar at night was a nice place to enjoy a nightcap before bed or before dinner - the staff was very friendly and the cocktail selection was really good.

"1442",1,"Admittedly our selection of the Elysee was price-driven. In a city like London, it was relatively cheap. But pay peanuts, get monkeys... Three of us booked a triple room - there was barely enough room to walk without smashing hipbones on the ledge built onto the wall to hold the tea/coffee. In truth, it should have been a double without the added single bed. Protests had us moved to a quad room - no larger really but a spare bed to park the bags. The remaining complaints are all small, but together combine to give an overall feeling of dissatisfaction: Extremely uncomfortable mattress (swapped the next day.) Dirty blankets (replaced the next day.) Only one towel each and no bath mat. Refurbished interior but tacky around the edges. Free internet only accessible in the foyer on your laptop - at painfully slow speeds. (Very expensive broadband available.) Breakfast (included) was toast, 2 juices, 2 cereals, coffee and a cold hard boiled egg. Every morning. The Elysee is in a good location but one gets the impression that it is milking that by cramming as many guests in to it's rooms at as low a cost per head as it can. Certainly, it was full over the weekend. If all you want is a bed, go for it. If you want a comfortable bed and more, look elsewhere...","en"

"1446",2,"Stayed here for three nights. Hotel is well located at the heart of Knightsbridge and close to Hyde park and staff is polite. I stayed in the sister property before (The Levin), so decided to try this one out. The rooms are rather small but clean and simply furnished. The real problem was the noise. I was given a room overlooking the service yard at the back. First night, the noise started at 7am with banging, dragging and slamming noises along with loud talk and continued from there on. During breakfast I complained to the hotel as I was in dire need for a good night sleep and asked to please change the room. They did change it but gave me exactly the same room two floors up! They explained that because it was now weekend, there will be no more delivery noise early in the morning. This was not to be. Before 7am the following morning I was abruptly woken up by the same loud banging coming from the multiple delivery activities downstairs. In brief, if you're looking for some peace and quiet, this place is not for you.","en"
"1447",5,"My partner and I stayed for one night a Saturday at the Double Tree by Hilton, Ealing. Our room was furnished to a high standard with tea and coffee making facilities and bottle water. A flat screen TV and well appointed ensuite shower room. A short walk from Ealing Common underground station and the common. Our breakfast was included in the price. There was a comprehensive choice at breakfast and everything was well presented. All the staff that we encountered where helpful. We were given two chocolate cookies by the reception staff to thank us for booking with them. I would have no hesitation in staying at this hotel again when next in this area.","en"

The area around seemed fine for a woman on her own, there was a pub next door that served food. The rooms were really nice and clean and a good size, very impressed. I got a cheaper rate as I paid upfront on my credit card, worth remembering!! The tube stop was literally opposite the hotel!!","en"

"1452",3,"I had a similar experience to many other Tripadvisor guests. The location is perfect, just around the corner from Earl's Court (we caught the tube from Heathrow), the room was clean and small, the staff were friendly and very helpful, it's walking distance to good food and shops, and the breakfast was perfect for our needs. However, our first floor room had no air conditioning or fans, and we weren't comfortable leaving the French style glass doors open all night (the doors opened onto a small verandah which was also accessible to the room next door) so it was a very hot night for us. The verandah was sprinkled with cigarette butts and hadn't been cleaned for a while, but it's not the sort of verandah guests would use, so this didn't bother us. There is very minimal disruption from traffic noise in this street, just the odd siren from the main road, which is a plus. If you do your research you'll know what to expect here, and appreciate what you get.","en"
"1453",1,"The hotels location is its best quality! We wanted somewhere that was cheap with a clean bed/shower/toilet where we could dump our stuff and have a short walk to all the attractions of London! The staff were friendly and helpful and even stored our luggage for us when we had checked out so we could explore some more! The rooms were small granted but it was fine for us! Bit of advice for people wanting to book here, If your looking for something cheap, great location and a clean bed to sleep then book it! If you want to spend any time in the hotel other than to sleep/shower rather than having a base to explore from I would advise to pay more and stay somewhere else. The reason for this is that the rooms are very small and some people may find this hard to overlook. Whilst we were staying there was some construction taking place so fingers crossed they are extending as they could make the rooms bigger which would make a massive difference!!","en"

"1460",5,"We stayed at Princes Square for a weekend early november, and we loved it! We have been to London before and didn't have any expectations whatsoever for the accomodation. We got a very nice room on 2. floor, (think it was nr 101) clean, new bathroom with a wonderful and big shower with steaming hot water, and big soft and fresh towels every day. We also loved the continental breakfast, never anything missing, and an abbundant english breakfast for a 5 pound fee. Always hot and nice inside the hotel, and a comfortable elevator. The only little thing we didnt like was that you easily could hear the neighbour's rooms because of no isolated walls. We anyway felt that this was the perfect base for a stay in London, situated in a quiet neighbourhood, but only 2 minute walk from busy Queens Road and both Bayswater and Queens tubestation. We will definately come back for more stays. Marte & Marco Antonelli","en"

"1462",4,"Stayed one night in November 2012. Staff are all nationalities but all try to make your stay comfortable. They've obviously been told to get as much feedback from customers as possible. My phone booking to their European HQ had netted me a double room with a kingsize bed for £83 (a Thursday). My room was fine with the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in. Luckily I'd read reviews on Tripadvisor beforehand so I knew about some problems. Passing under the air-conditioning gives one a cold draught which competes with the central heating. Couldn't work the a/c control to reduce this. Likewise no TV control explanation so they sent an ""engineer"" to my room to assist. The coffee in the room requires opening a sachet. Inside is a cardboard filter containing the coffee with lugs over the side of your paper mug to hold it open. The first 100 mls filter through fine but the second time onwards and the cardboard starts to sag and fall in the paper beaker. I persevered and managed to fill two thirds of the beaker. But even after using both the white and demerara .sugar packets and both milk servings (this was supposed to be for two occupants) the coffe was still too strong and bitter for me. Breakfast is a meagre affair. Cereals, croissants, bananas, apples (any 3 items) plus a beverage (no saucers). Sugar for cereals, one uses the paper beverage sachets. I pointed out that some hotels offer sugar dispensers that don't break hygiene laws (which had been their excuse) The reason why guests must eat this offering from a tray on their laps. is because the restaurant is not run by the hotel. So breakfast cannot be prepared in a proper kitchen or served with normal cafe seating. I didn't use the swimmong pool or the gymnasium. The HD tv in my room showed basically the main free channels (BBC, ITV etc), the rest mainly news channels. No listings for the evenings viewing. Couldn't see a shower cap but complimntary hairdryer (and iron with board). Couldn't see a temp control on the shower but the water was just right for me. Overall a comfortable hotel right next to the Excel. The staff try their hardest to overcome any problems you have. But lack of instructions for TV, lift operation etc plus food and beverage served in minimal quantities gives the appearance of penny-pinching.","en"
"1463",5,"I stayed here for a recent business trip and found the hotel to be of an excellent standard. I took the tube to High St Kensington and then walked the short distance to the hotel. I was promptly greeted by the concierge outside of the hotel who offered to carry my luggage in. At check in, I was promptly attended to and told everything I needed for my stay by a very pleasant receptionist. I had a lovely room on the 5th floor overlooking the park. In the evening I had a drink in the upstairs bar where again service was excellent, before heading out to an evening function. Upon my return later in the evening, my room had been turned down and a complimentary bottle of water and a pastry had been left for me. I didn't stay for breakfast in the morning but overall I would highly recommend staying here and I certainly will do so when I am next in the area either for business or pleasure.","en"
"1464",4,"We stayed here for one night and arrived really late (12am!) so can't really talk too much about the hotel facilities etc as we didnt really experience them HOWEVER I would stay again based solely on the treatment we received from staff. I particularly want to mention aijaz(not sure of spelling?) at the front desk who gave us an upgrade to a deluxe room, free water and grapes as well as the late checkout we really needed after the late time that we arrived. He was super friendly and understanding and full of jokes even at such a late hour. The rest of the staff were also amazingly friendly and helpful but unfortunately I didn't catch anyone else's name. The location of the hotel is perfect in my opinion, you are away from the noise of central but literally 2 stops away on the central line from marble arch and oxford street and another stop westbound takes you to notting hill and holland park (must visit the cafes in holland park so cute). The area is so convenient so many nice places to eat at nearby (try Khans) and a quiet shopping centre should you not feel up to fighting other shoppers in oxford street. The rooms are comfortable enough, although slightly on the small side but more than enough room if you are just staying a few days and our bathroom had a bathtub which was nice. Overall I would definitely stay again although I do feel it is slightly overpriced for the size of the room but the service more than makes up for it.","en"
"1465",5,"I stayed at the Royalhorse Guards for two nights while attending a conference and was very impressed. I've stopped in a few London hotels over the years and have had a few bad experiences but not on this occasion. My room was very nicely presented, spotlessly clean and the reception staff and porters where incredibly helpful, the location of the hotel is just about as good as it gets. A real bugbear with me is bottled water and I'm pleased to report that it is, as it should be, complementary, not £5 a bottle (K-West Shepherds Bush, shame on you). The thing that stands out the most is the service, this was superb, friendly, attentive and efficient. My only negative was the bar prices £26 for a large glass of wine and a bottle of beer ouch! But I guess you've got to pay for that service somehow.","en"
"1466",5,"A place to stay for a trip to see The Jersey Boys and, after trawling the internet I came across the Britannia. We got a special deal for a twin room that included breakfast so to be honest at £158 for two nights for two people we weren't expecting The Ritz. However how wrong were we in fact what we got was a warm, smiley welcome which set the theme for the weekend. I have to be honest we were given a room that immediately put me in the 'grr' frame of mind, one right by the lifts and one that although it backed on to the waterfront also to the DLR railway. I always travel with earplugs so to be honest it wouldn't have been a problem however we never had any distubance from the lifts and the railway, due to engineering works only ran on the Friday evening. My only other three issues with the room were that the twin beds were single ones, I guess that comes with being spoilt at other hotels that provide doubles, the shower head (tiny) and lack of lighting (make-up application). Other than that everyting was pretty much spot-on. We decided to eat in on Friday, no booking required and headed to Jenny's Carvery. Fantastic helpful, friendly staff one of whom when we departed on Sunday morning after our ample full english, shook our hands and said 'It's always sad when nice people check out'! Three courses for £15 - excellent! Our only critiscm here was lack of signage - nothing to say three courses, some of the food items on offer and refreshments on the tea/coffee table didn't have appropriate signage. The whole bill for both with drinks came to £40. Saturday morning we sampled the breakfast selection, fruit, yoghurt, toast, cereals and full English. Obviously we didn't have all of the above (no yoghurt) and again it was excellent. We dined in the Pizzeria Saturday evening - total bill with tip for starter, mains (including perfectly cooked sea bass) came to £47 for two. The only disappointment were the coffees in the bar later in the evening, although the Baileys cheered them up! Again on Sunday we enjoyed the breakfast. All in all I'm looking forward to staying there again in the near future. I cannot speak highly enough of the staff. It's worth mentioning too that the waiter in the Pizzeria has worked there for several years which for the hotel/catering industry speaks volumes. A big thumbs up Britannia International - in a climate of financial doom and gloom you certainly put two big smiles on these 'girls' faces! On-site parking too at excellent rate - Thank you!","en"

There was free wifi in the hotel &our room.

"1471",4,"Just stayed this Bank Holiday weekend and was really impressed by this fab hotel. We booked through Lastminute.com's secret hotels and hoped it would be this hotel as it had good reviews and a great location and we were certainly not disappointed. Very impresses by the great attention to detail in our room from the fab bathroom with heated mirrors, night mode lighting, amazing shower and proper bath tub with shower attachment too, to really luxurious twin Queen size beds, sofa and a light for every purpose and even a button to tell the maid when the room is ready for cleaning! Really pleased that they granted our wish for a high level room and really surprised to find a cake waiting in it as I had mentioned in passing it was our wedding anniversary. Made us feel really special and the view from floor 11 was so good we couldn't bear to close the curtains! Spa area fab too with a proper size swimming pool as well as all the usuals you would expect from a 5 star plus an unusual foot spa! Staff attentive and welcoming. Can't wait to come back!","en"
"1472",2,"Staff: Some are really well mannered and warm. Namely the manager. She was very welcoming and professional. Location: Not the best. Attached club, made the hotel too hectic of an atmosphere. Drunkards smoking cigarettes outside the hotel ruined the classy ambiance. Security must be beefed up, not only outside the club, but at the entrance as well. Ambiance: Terrible. The composition of perfumed bathing hotel guests, made the lift unbreathable. Also the screaming and loud guests made the lobby feel like a marketplace. Silence or good etiquettes should be observed or reminded to the guests. Room service quality: Breakfast was poorly prepared and reluctantly eaten. Work on your basics like scrambled eggs..... only toasts should be that dry. French toast, a diabetes home run. Lunch, cheese and tomato sandwich was terrible. Too much fancy flavours in one sandwich. Keep it simple. Soup was just ok. Coffee was good. Sleep quality: Bed was nice n snuggly. But air conditioners blast made sleep uncomfortable. Exit door in front of bed was awkward, could hear people going in and out during the day and continued throughout the night. My entourage had 3 rooms. One Schiaparelli Suite, One Bamboo Suite and One One Bedroom King Suite. Interior of all rooms were good and well decorated. No problems there. Concierge: During check out day, waited 45 minutes for concierge. 3 persons answered the phone 3 persons with all different answers. Reception: Told of check out date. A day before the actual date. Packed our things. Settled the bill, front desk realised made a mistake. Imagine the horror. Will my entourage and myself stay at this hotel again?........................... Does not look good for now. Lower your prices to fit your service. Alert your staff to quiet down your noisy guests. Take back control of your lobby ambiance. Rearrange your hotel furnitures and etc. Fire your room service chef/s. Room service reception speaks poor english. All this makes your 5 star status at stake.","en"

"1476",4,"This was a last minute (ish) one night stay having got tickets for the basketball final and the North Greenwich Arena. Location to the arena is fab, less than a mile walk which is much quicker than queuing for tubes or water taxis after the event. The rate included breakfast and although that was quite basic it was at least something. The room was a really good size and it was quiet when we opened the window surprisingly. Tea and coffee in room is always a nice touch shame no biccies :) The staff were pleasant, the hotel was clean and in what appeared to be a very quiet safe area. Fun with the lift, we were OK but a few people struggled with the card system and took a few extra rides up and down.

"1478",5,"Situated in the area of the Earl's Court exhibition centre, this hotel is very close to Earls Court underground station, which services the District Line and the Piccadilly Line. The last one will get you both to and from Heathrow if applicable and will get you into town easily. The area around the hotel (Earls Court Road) is great if you want a pub or grab some food at the great Indian place (Masala Zone) The staff in the hotel is lovely and helpful. My partner was celebrating his birthday (the whole reason for our trip to London) and we received a lovely bottle of bubbly compliments of the house. The Breakfast was really good, a lot of choice and very well priced for a 4star hotel in London (I believe it was around 17 pound) . We were in a room in the basement and it was a nice size, fair enough for 2 people. I've read comments that the bathroom is too small... I would agree it is small, but definitely not too small for these types of building and again the price of the room is so reasonable (for London!) that you simply cannot expect a bigger bathroom. I would hazard a guess that it is about 5 m2 and has a sink, small bath, toilet and great shower - I usually find waterpressure a failure in hotels in general, but this was great!","en"

Staff recommended a couple of pubs close by and we weren't disappointed. Only a couple minor negatives, bed seemed to be in need of replacing- just seemed worn out and the breakfast room was a little tight. Overall we will be back to further explore London.","en"
"1480",5,"Here it goes... Long story short... My husband surprised me with a visit to his hotel. Didn't know much about it. It was to celebrate our 15th year Anniversary together. Literally from the moment you walk in you have entered a whole different experience. Once you have spoken to the lovely people on reception you are greeted by more staff to take you upstairs where you are sat down by who I presume is the manager. The champagne starts flowing and the staff cannot seem to help you enough! Then the best part of the whole experience for myself and my husband was being directed and shown to your room. We walked in and was blown away. We had a guided tour of what turned out to be the Conservatory Suite which we was upgraded too. Our champagne was already in our room and there was a cake and more chocolates downstairs. Upstairs is the gigantic room and it obviously being the conservatory room the roof was all glass... The tour just carried on. We was shown the bathroom with the jacuzzi and shower with tv on wall. There were TVs everywhere in this room. I just could not believe it when my husband told me that this wasn't the room he booked and that this was the best room in the entire hotel. So to be upgraded to this room was UNBELIEVABLE. The drinks are just fantastic... The food does not end and my husband and I took full advantage of that in the evening, even after our meal out. Heading back to the room in the evening, the room has been changed. Candles and rose petals everywhere including some lovely Elemis products on the pillows. Not only that. We was given a £50 credit towards anything we wanted to spend it on. So we decided to use it for breakfast which was DELICIOUS... The most wonderful touch was when we had to leave. Hardest thing I've had to do. My husband found a book he liked and couldn't find it in the shops. He spoke to one of the ladies and asked if he could purchase it. They said unfortunately it's not for sale but when we went to check out, they wrapped the book up with their signature carnation flower and presented it to my husband as a parting gift. Would I go back... Tomorrow if I could... Do I recommend it... Silly question... If only I could take all the staff they have home with me... THIS HOTEL IS OUTSTANDING AND THANK YOU FROM THE BOTTOM OF OUR HEARTS... From The Hydes...","en"

Other than that it was a great hotel and would stay here again if ever in London again.","en"
"1482",4,"I stayed there for 4 nights (6/24 - 6/28/2005). What a nice little hotel! The room was small, but, clean and nicely decorated. I believe the room had recently been refurbished because the bed was firm and the furniture/carpet/bath were in excellent condition. The breakfast was delicious and filling (I tried both the contintental and English ones). The staff was very helpful. Earlier in the week I was staying at a nearby hotel that was not as good in quality and at nearly the same price. The Burns was a much better value (I got a good rate via the internet). Yes, the floors creak, there's no A/C and the lift is small. But, this is a very fine budget hotel in a city notoriously known for lousy inexpensive accommodations. The location is excellent, on a quite sidestreet just off the busy Earl's Court Rd and tube stop. I could get to anywhere in central London in about 15mins by tube. I would definitely stay there again. Nice job, BW Burns Hotel!","en"

The staff was very helpfull and friendly and we didn't have to wait untill 2 pm before we could get into our room.

"1484",3,"We have just returned from a one night stay in London for the jubilee celebrations and chose this hotel for its proximity to Hyde Park. We were not disappointed with our choice as the hotel certainly provided everything we needed and expected. All staff were friendly, helpful and professional at all times and although we arrived far too early to check in we were able to leave our bag (£1 a bag) knowing that it was secure while we explored London. We returned to the hotel late in the evening exhausted and were very pleased with our double room, it was comfortable and spotlessly clean. The bed was extremely comfortable and there were spare pillows and a blanket all sealed in containers in the bottom of the wardrobe. Our room was in the basement and the only minor issue was the fact that we could hear the tubes, however this was not a problem to us and did not keep us awake! It may be a problem if you are a light sleeper. We wanted to be up and out early the next morning and it was good that breakfast was served from 6.30a.m. There was a choice of hot and cold buffet and staff quickly brought fresh coffee pots to the table as requested, they were very attentive while not being intrusive. The hotel is situated between two tube situations, Queensway and Lancaster Gate. We used Queensway which was approximately 5 minute walk away. An excellent 3 star hotel which I would visit again and would recommend.","en"

In this day and age, it is ridiculous for guests to be charged for Wi-fi. This should be included in the rather costly room rate. Also the only hotel on our trip to charge us a pound per bag to store our luggage for a few hours between check out and heading to the airport. Not a good look for an otherwise comfy hotel in a good location.","en"
"1487",5,"I had initially booked this hotel for its central location and reasonable price, but soon after got apprehensive after reading some of the reviews on here. My worries were completely unfounded, my girlfriend and I had a very pleasant stay in what turned out to be a real bargain in the middle of London. All the staff were friendly and helpful and it gave the place a very chilled out atmosphere. The room was clean, tidy, and had everything we needed. A (really comfortable!) King size bed, and bathroom with a surprisingly powerful shower. It didn't sport many little extras (like shampoos or soaps), but did have a little tv, and a mini kettle which came in handy. It was a basic room, but it was done well. Clean, comfortable and quiet. The breakfast was similarly basic but perfectly reasonable. There was a good choice of cereals, yoghurts, juices, toast, bacon, sausages, scrambled egg, croissants, pretty much what you'd expect. Nothing to write home about, but it was decent and did the job. The real winner however is the location. We were a quick ten minute walk from King's Cross which took us wherever we needed to go and meant it was really easy to pop back and forth to the hotel without worrying about how to get there. It's ideal as a home base for those looking to explore London for a few days. It's not for those looking for a luxurious pampered stay. This hotel is basic, but it does the important things right. Friendly, clean, comfortable, and in a fantastically accessible location. Definitely recommended.","en"
"1488",3,"I stayed at this hotel on New Year's Eve. I got a great deal on LastMinute.Com through the secret hotels offer. It was so cheap for a central hotel in London on N Y Eve, I was amazed and simply had to book it. The hotel is centrally located within walking distance from Old Steet tube, plus there are several night bus stops close by as well. It's a little tricky to find and you suddenly come across it as you walk there. It's kind of in the middle of a residential area close to a council estate. The lobby is huge and posh. The reception staff are efficient and friendly. I stayed in a room opposite the reception, meaning you walk across a terrace and use your room card and enter another block. I found this to be fine. I took the lift to my room and was delighted with it. It was clean, well presented and very nice-looking for a London hotel. ( I have stayed in many London hotels in the 3-4 star range and few are as good as this..most are old and drab as that is the way London hotels are....) I had a TV with all cable channels, instant coffee/tea and kettle and free toilettries in the bathroom. The shower worked well, the room had decent sound proofing, the bed was comfy and I really liked it. I also felt safe (being a female). The hotel is quite big and tonnes of rooms line the corridor. The room is fairly small but not unusually so - the regular size of London four star hotels is small, but it wasn't too small. The concierge was really friendly and helped me with all my travel queries and seemed really knowledgeable about everything from taxis to buses - he was impressive. The only downside of this hotel is the location - in the sense it does border a council estate and at night, in the dark, you would not want to walk back from Old Street tube alone (at least not after 11pm). Having said that, it is only a 10-15 min walk and if you did walk back (as I did at 3am) it's unlikely anything will happen. The problem is there aren't that many people wandering around...on N Y Eve there were but that was an exception. I would suggest you get a cab home if walking back alone. There is a nightbus stop closer than the tube, but not that close and still a walk through some dark roads.. The breakfast the next day consisted of a help yourself buffet - scrambled eggs, croissants, pain au chocolats, make your own toast, fruit, fruit juice, coffee and tea - and some other stuff I didnt have...It was very nice and filling and breakfast staff were very attentive and professional and the ambience on N Y Day was great. It was heaving by the way. It's a popular hotel and lots of people stay there. The best part about this hotel is the pool though. There is an amazing indoors heated pool, sauna, steam room and jacuzzi that is just unspeakably good...I spent an hour in there relaxing and detoxing - I felt so great afterwards. The fact you get to use this for free if you stay in the hotel is unbeatable. You can swim proper lengths, and it's not the crowded. It's clean and really really nice. I love this place and would go back for sure. The concierge looked after my stuff as well when I checked out and I came back and collected it. Everything about this hotel is great. I highly recommend it.","en"

Highly recommend. One comment - Leicester Square is currently being completely renovated. So, a lot of construction going on in preparation for the Olympics. I didn't see it as a problem.","en"
"1493",5,"The Hotel is in a convenient location for the Tower Hill area. That's were the good stuff ends. The room was tiny, stuffy and had not been decorated for at least 20 years. The wallpaper was vile. The bathroom was cramped. I had a charming view of some rooftops. I've stayed in far nicer rooms in a travelodge. Breakfast is adequate at best. The tables are spaced centimetres apart - far too close to the next person. The swimming pool is overun by people who live nearby and are members of the gym. They act like they own the place. I would never waste my money by staying at a Grange Hotel again.","en"

"1495",4,"This is my hotel of choice whenever I visit London. My recent stays at the hotel where both excellent. The single room without a view was small but comfortable and clean. The buffet breakfast was one of the best I've experienced at a hotel. I'm a vegetarian, and there were many choices for me. The location cannot be beat. The service at the Strand Palace goes beyond what one would expect at a hotel. A screw, in my carry on bag's handle, had fallen out while traveling to London. I asked at the concierge's desk where I could get the bag fixed. I was told that someone at the hotel would fix the bag. I brought it to the desk the next morning, and it was fixed in about an hour. I had written a comment, about something that happened at the Strand Carvery. I was immediately contacted by Adnan, the duty manager, to discuss my comment. He listened to me and assured me that my comment would be addressed. When he heard that I was a repeat guest and that I would be returning in a few weeks, he offered to upgrade my room for my next stay. I was happily upgraded to a king executive room which was spacious, clean, and extremely comfortable. With the upgrade came access to the executive breakfast dining room which had an even larger selection than the regular breakfast dining room. The people, who work at the Strand Palace, are friendly, attentive, and concerned about the comfort of their guests. I will happily stay there the next time I visit London. Thank you to everyone at the hotel who where so friendly and helpful.","en"
"1496",3,"I have stayed in London in many very nice hotels and this was definitely my worst experience. I was expecting a modern luxury hotel but in the reality the hotel had a personality of the ice cube. Lobby is huge and unwelcoming. Nobody was there to help with our bags which was very strange in this class of the hotel. Very little staff helping with anything. Rooms are ok but hardly luxurious, with very sloppy paintwork. Cleanness in the bathroom was only on eye level. Mostly catered for big tourist groups or conference crowds, causing long queues at breakfast. Breakfast was good, although looked like a zoo. Breakfast staff is under pressure to move and serve fast, so very few smiles. If you like shopping then location is OK, although Oxford street shops have turned to cheap crap stores and it is not the same as it used to. There are so many other options in town for that price in nicer neighborhoods.","en"
"1497",5,"The May Fair is such a nice hotel. Very polite and attentive staff. In fact, upon having waited for just a few moments too many for the reception to give me my key card after a quick city run, I was offered a complimentary entrance to their beautiful SPA. The room was spacious and came with massive wardrobes, and a well stocked minibar. The bathroom was large and well designed, with high end spa-style products. And also, I really loved the room service salad I ordered. In short, I'd happily return. (My wallet might not be equally happy though. Luckily, it is not consulted.)","en"
"1498",4,"After staying in another Holiday Inn recently, I was apprehensive to say the least when my office booked me into the Holiday Inn in Bloomsbury for my latest business trip. However I found the hotel to be well appointed, quiet, conveniently located and lots of local amenities. It's within walking distance of the centre of the city (which I did three times during my stay) and as mentioned in other reviews, Russell Square Underground is located in the next street. The only points stopping me giving another star are the pillows are very comfy and I had to wait quite a while to check in. I would stay here again.","en"

"1503",5,"I was booked in here by my company for three nights and having stayed many times in HIE hotels I knew what to expect, which is a reasonable hotel with good facilities. The hotel is on a very busy road, but I got onto the quieter side (East) but still slept with ear plugs in. My room was clean and everything worked and the shower was also good, the menu for evening meals are fairly limited but adequate for a short stay, on my first night the wifi was not working in the hotel. My biggest gripe was that as I was checking in I was told that I had to either pay a £50 cash deposit or a £30 deposit on a card, when I enquired why this was I was informed that it was 'in case I damage anything in the room' I asked the receptionist if he meant it was pre authorisation for meals as the room was paid for, and he reiterated that it was a deposit in case of damage, to say I was supprised is an understatement, in the hundreds of hotels I have stayed in I have never been told that, I even suggested that as an IHG Rewards member it did not look good that they did not trust their business customers, he just said it was company policy, he did not actually seem to know what my IHG Rewards card was. So I'm working for the same client in Romford this week, and guess what? I'm staying in a different hotel, one where the customer is valued.","en"

"1506",5,"I've stayed in Premier Inns all over the country any admire their consistency. Excellent location just 2 or 3 minutes from Blackfriars Tube station, easy access to the sights of central London and very quiet at night. Staff are welcoming, friendly and helpful. Only ate in the Thyme Restaurant on one night but food was good, childrens meals were especially good value. Room was clean, simple and well equipped - great aircon too. OK, so would I recommend it? Yes. I've been in several 4 star hotels which look shabby, the staff see you as an inconvenience and you're charged a fortune for the experience. Premier Inns are simple, straightforward and great value. As a family user they are ideal and we will certainly be using Blackfriars PI again when we revisit London. 5 stars.","en"

Both us and our friends had one bedroom suites which were absolutely amazing. The room had a huge suite area, bedroom and bathroom which was was fantastic. It had a large rainshower and a tv you could watch whilst in the bath! I also loved the fact that it had a massive mirror on one wall and a small pull out mirror on the opposite wall soThe rooms were modernly decorated and felt very luxurious. The hotel doesn't have parking onsite but you drive right up to the door and the concierge park your car for you. We went to the o2 for the evening and the location of the hotel was brilliant. You can actually see the dome across the river right outside the hotel. It only cost us £15 for the short taxi ride (about 10 minutes) which the hotel staff had offered to book for us when we checked in as there were no jubilee line tubes running that night. It was a perfect weekend! I can't fault it at all.","en"
"1513",5,"I'm sitting at home wishing I were back in to Hotel Indigo Tower Hill. I booked this hotel for my boyfriends Birthday. We're London residence so we rarely stay in London hotels ... However on this occasion I want to do something special and the excellent reviews helped me pick the Indigo. Originally the check-in time was going to be a problem as we were due to be somewhere at 3pm. A quick email to ask for an earlier check-in was promptly answered and we were told that our room would be ready and it wouldn't be a problem. On arrival we were greeted with honest smiles and a warm welcome. We were given the stunning King Executive room and were told we had a complimentary late check out (2pm). We quickly settled in with our complimentary minibar (soft drinks, fruit juices, waters, chocolate etc) and loved the TV greeting 'Welcome to Indigo Mr & Miss *****, Please enjoy your stay.) The room was large and cool, and tastefully decorated with an array of lamps and spot lights. The bed was stunning and so soft (best night sleep I've had in ages) and the large bathroom was a treat! The TV was a good size with a fantastic choice of channels, and the Nespresso machine quickly became my new best friends (plenty of teas/coffee too. No need to ask for refills.) As we were getting ready for bed we noticed we had forgotten our toothpaste. A quick call to reception (at 11:45pm) had a toothpaste and toothbrush delivered to our room in minutes! The next morning we had a delicious breakfast of Porridge and Eggs Florentine in the adjoining Square Mile Lounge and a complimentary newspaper. Our check-out was swift and friendly, and we were able to leave our bags with the reception team until we wanted to collect them later in the day. All in all it was one of the most wonderful hotels we've had the pleasure of visiting (and we stay in approx. 8 hotels a year.) I can't wait to stay again! Exceptional!","en"

"1515",4,"We stayed here for one night. It was a standard room with King sized bed. The bed was very comfortable but I was once again singularly unsuccessful in persuading the lady at Reception to give us an upgrade based on being a Gold member of their IHG Rewards club. She made it a point however to thank me for my loyalty but it appears you need to be a Platinum member to qualify for an upgrade. That will explain why I have never had an upgrade ever with this group of hotels. Yes, the room was spacious but clearly that made for a smaller size bathroom. The bath itself was so narrow that a more corpulent torso could have got wedged! That apart, the bath filled quickly (especially also because it was small!) and the shower worked well.. Housekeeping was ever so efficient. We went out for the evening and returned to find the bed was made and towels replaced. One needs to be aware that the valet parking offered comes at a steep price. Their website quotes £50 for 24 hours. I paid £62.50 for 25 hours. Of course one needs also to remember this is central London. The location cannot be better. Hyde Park just across the road and Hyde Park Corner Underground station on Piccadilly Line easily accessed through the subway just outside the premises.","en"

The staff, and I mean everybody from the door men, chamber maids, hotels front desk, bar men and Resturant wait staff, concierge, performed at a level that is rare at most hotels today! I applaud the management for having such a cohesive team. The design of the hotel was unusual and very hip and very comfortable. Coupled with the 1st class location in the heart of the west end it is a winner. I loved the wood paneling in the bedrooms and loved the bed. What a great nights sleep.

"1522",4,"My husband and I had a pleasant stay at this hotel. The first evening, we requested to change rooms because there was a constant, loud screeching noise coming from outside that was like nails on a chalkboard; I never found out what it was, but I certainly couldn't endure it. Our request to change rooms was accommodated immediately and without any fuss; the new room didn't have a nice view but it was very quiet and I slept very well for the rest of our stay. I was impressed with the service we received to resolve the issue! I must say that the bed was super comfortable as well and the room was nice and dark thanks to some effective blackout curtains. The hotel is ideally located right beside the Southwark tube station on the Jubilee line and in reasonable walking distance to the Eye and other tourist destinations. I actually really liked the ""pod"" concept bathroom - very efficient use of space, with lovely hot showers. Breakfast was very tasty and had wheat-free options which I really appreciated as someone with a wheat allergy. We had breakfast at the hotel only once though as it was quite expensive. Wi-Fi was free and fast.","en"
"1523",5,"Our family of 5 (myself, husband and 3 children ages 8,9,11) spent 11 nights here. We reserved a room for 5 (1 double bed and 3 single beds) on the main floor. We still had enough floor space to walk around without difficulty and had our own bathroom. It is extremely difficult to find a good London budget hotel in a great location that can accommodate a family of 5 in one or adjoining rooms. The Rees family work very hard and were very kind and helpful to our family. They spent a good part of each morning helping their guests with directions and suggestions. The hotel has a common room with sofas, TV, free coffee and tea machine, and a desk-top computer for FREE internet use. Breakfast is included and was very good. The Ridgemount Hotel is one of the best values in London. We will definelty return. We loved our stay there.","en"

"1525",2,"Myself, son and grand daughter stayed here whilst the Olympics were on and definitely not impressed with the staff or breakfast. Peckham Lodge lived up to the reviews I had read on before booking. The room was clean although not the one which we expected, the WiFi hardly ever worked, a member of staff was rude when it was pointed out that there were 2 wheels missing off the bed and breakfast didn't give much choice - cornflakes, rice crispies, toast and drinks and croissants only if you stayed around long enough! They were also still completing refurbushments at the time which again, I thought they would have finished and from reviews seem to have gone on for some time. I suppose you get what you pay for as we did want something cheap and had left finding accomodation quite late so met our needs. On a good note, it is on the bus route with plenty of shops and takeawys nearby and there was a lift right outside of our room which I think they took notice of when I advised I had an impairment to my leg.

"1527",4,"This is a great hotel in a wonderful area of London. It's within walking distance of major shops on Oxford Street and a short jaunt to some great restaurants and pubs. The rooms are comfortable and pleasant and the hotel staff is willing to take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that your visit is pleasurable. All-in-all, a good experience for a couple making their first visit to London. A couple of points worth noting... Although we requested an early check-in, we were not actually shown our room until 4:30 pm, well after the 3:00 pm check-in. The hotel staff continually claimed that they were ""fully booked"" and had several ""late check-outs"", but didn't seem particularly sympathetic, even though we had flown all night and my wife was on the verge of collapse. We eventually only got our room by sitting in the lobby and refusing to budge until it was available. Our next surprise came when we were taken to the room itself and found we were given a unit in the basement of the hotel, which gave us an eye-level view of a nearby alley. Not exactly what we were hoping when we're paying 235 GBP per night and had booked the room months in advance. To be fair, we did appreciate the relative peace and quiet of the basement suite after a few days and the room was very well appointed with all the amenities promised in the hotel's online advertisements. Still, we had hoped for better, especially since being in the basement, our room was often not cleaned by the time we had returned from our travels at around 4:30pm each day. As for the HUNter 486 restaurant, I would suggest stopping by for drinks at any time and getting to know the talented and charming wait staff. I would eat at least one dinner at the restaurant because the food is extremely good. Skip breakfast, which for our money was vastly overpriced and not particularly tasty. Instead, head down towards Oxford Street and have a great and much cheaper breakfast at Patisserie Valerie or the Pret a Manger. Would we stay here again? Possibly. But I might want to take a look at other options in the area to find a better combination of price and value for money.","en"
"1528",3,"I stayed in this hotel with my wonderful boyfriend. Located within walking distance of paddington station and also hyde park, this hotel was good value for money considering the generally high prices of London. However, the double room we were given was very small and claustrophobic. The room was clean and had free wifi, but unfortunately the breakfast was an absolute disaster. The breakfast room was very small and we were told there was not enough space for us to eat (our purchase included breakfast with the room) when we first went down, and this affected our plans for the day as we were delayed. When we finally got space to eat (half an hour later), the breakfast was OK but the mushrooms had a piece of mud in it! We were not impressed and when we showed this to the waitress she just laughed and took it away without an explanation of how it got there! Overall an adequate but unimpressive hotel.","en"

They serve a very nice traditional english breakfast, but if you don't like it you can order different things, The breakfast ladies were very kind. The only thing I have to complain is the rudeness of the guys at the reception. They were very cold and didn't like to answer many questions.","en"

Parking for 24 hours was a reasonable £15 and the room £74.99 as we booked in advance. The room was clean and warm. The only problem with the room for me was that the bed was too soft but this is a personal thing. Breakfast was included and although not brilliant, it was perfectly adequate.","en"
"1532",4,"Hotel feels old and in need of [at minimum] refreshment. At reception my double standard was substituted with a twin. At the time I could not care less since a hotel room for me is not used for much more than sleeping. Unfortunately this is where the issue came up later - I spent the night in a bed that was up there with the most uncomfortable ones I have had in my life. The twin room basically offers two really small beds put together next to each other. It would have been OK if they would stick together, but they roll away if your leg gets in between them. The two distinct characterictics of this bed are - short and narrow. Legs are hanging out in the air and if you turn from one side to the other, knees and elbows get out. The bed would still be OK for a child or a rather short adult. Interior is visibly old, but the room and bathroom were clean. Some rooms do not have windows (mine did). Breakfast greeted me with a long queue - which probably happens often since there was a sign ""queue here"". The reason might be that groups of tourists staying at the hotel go together - queue was later gone. Keep it in mind if you leave little time for breakfast - I waited 7-8min to get to the food selection. Breakfast was English breakfast - nothing to write home about, but covers the basics. If you are into sweet stuff or fruits, you will not be excited by the offering. The room had an iron and an ironing board. Not much more to add really - forst, and I am guessing last time staying at this place for me.","en"

No view from the room, had we been aware that city views were an option, we would have paid the extra. Very clean hotel, stylish, and reasonably priced. Strong smell of paint on the floor we were on but thankfully not in the room. Bathroom very nice.

"1536",1,"extremely helpful and friendly staff, clean and well-kept rooms, but no elevator. Great location, just around the block from Paddington, the Heathrow Express and several underground lines. Bad pay-to-go internet service (extremely slow, only 21% signal in my room) not worth the money at all, otherwise everything fine! Will definitely stay there again.","en"
"1537",3,"We had afternoon tea at the waldorf which was OK but not a particularly special experience. We were offered a bad table right next to the door,which we requested to change (why do restuarants always offer their worst tables first?) When seated we were left alone for quite a while before taken any notice of. Not very welcoming.However the sandwiches were very good and fresh as were the delicious warm scones & clotted cream. We were offered more sandwiches and tea.....which we eagerly accepted. As it was a special occasion we were given a small piece of gateau between us....which was tasty and a nice touch. The room was quite grand with a harp player although as a couple we were tucked away in a corner. We were on a half price voucher which made it good value but I would not be happy to pay the full price of £42 each for this ""afternoon tea experience""","en"

"1542",5,"Stayed at Dean St Townhouse in September '12 - it was recommended by a friend. All I can say is YUM! From the moment we stepped inside, we loved the atmosphere...the place oozes style and is a gorgeous fusion of English traditions and modern comforts. We stayed in a medium room which was huge, and featured (sighhhh) a freestanding vintage style bath in the room itself. The details were what I loved most - from the silver tea set with home made cookies, to the music player (styled to look vintage, but actually completely modern), to the great mags left for us to enjoy. Also adored the range of Cowshed goodies...unlike most hotels, there were a HUGE range of full size varieties of cosmetics that smelled divine (hadn't heard of the brand before but it was all delish smelling). One note, you can't take all the toiletries with you, as they're full size, but you can try the whole range and buy what you want if you choose to at the end. Apart from a great sleep and several baths we had breakfast in the restaurant twice, and the husband voted the full english the best he has ever had. He is english. And has had a lot of breakfasts. So I assume this is high praise :) We also had dinner and cocktails there one night which was equally fantastic. The location, right in the heart of soho, was terrific. So close to everything but tucked away in a hip little street so it didn't feel at all touristy. One warning - it IS noisy (or at least our room was) which you sort of expect in Soho. Didn't bother us but it may bother light sleepers or those who need peace & quiet. But in general, for a cool classy, comfy place to stay I can't recommend it enough...we will definitely be back!!!","en"

Having the gorgeous Christmas decorations up gave it a magical feel. The staff were lovely, professional and warm. The afternoon tea was super, our family party, made up of differing age ranges all enjoyed it. I am planning my next visit.","en"
"1545",4,"Stayed for the weekend with partner. The room was comfortable although dry and airless, with windows sealed shut and minimal air conditioning but the milk in the room was rancid so no tea/coffee. Asked for more and was promised it would be sent but it wasn't. Second day, more rancid milk, so we just went out and bought a pint in a local shop. Breakfast service is a joke, a tiny restaurant with a queue of 20 people waiting to be seated at 9.30 on a Sunday. The staff member at the restaurant door suggested going out for breakfast, and pointed us to a restaurant that did not open for another half an hour, saying ""that would be quicker"". The catering is a joke. Was due to be staying there again on business over the coming few months, I'll find somewhere where I can get fed in comfort; this is just not fit for purpose as far as I am concerned.","en"

The staff were all extremely friendly and the Duty Manager, Amy Kaur, arranged a birthday surprise when we returned from our night out - a lovely chocolate dessert with ""Happy Birthday"" in melted chocolate across the plate, such a nice thought thank you! The room was as you would expect for such a classy establishment and we were amazed by how quiet everything was. Lovely feeling in the lobby area too and such a grand entrance. Excellent hotel in a great location and made really special by the attentive staff.","en"
"1548",4,"The location of this hotel at first seemed to be a long way from anywhere but once there it's a short walk to Westminster and easy access to both Buses and Tube. We stayed in an executive room where everything you could think of was provided. A Mac computer which served as a TV, robes, very comfy bed, great shower (although bathroom could be a little larger) and comfortable chairs. The greeting at reception was warm, friendly and helpful and the cookie you receive was devoured eagerly once in the room and extremely good. We had breakfast included in our deal and on both mornings it was busy but not manic, the range of food simple but of good quality. The hot breakfast was placed on buffet in reasonable sized portions and replenished regularly ensuring hot, fresh food not warm and dry round the edges as can be the case on some hotel buffets - and can I just give the scrambled a mention as it was a triumph. We also had a quick lunch in the bar and again the food was of good quality, well presented, service was excellent and food came quickly- good if time is short. All in all a great experience and a hotel we will return too.","en"

"1552",5,"We wanted a sight seeing holiday in London for our family (2adults, 2children) and wanted something a little different. The Sunborn certainly delivered on that! As soon as we spotted it at the dock we couldn't believe our luck. It looks fantastic from the outside and is just as nice inside. Check in was quick and easy. We had booked an exec family room with balcony and were luck enough to be on the water side with great views of the O2, canary wharf etc. Room was a good size; plenty of space even with sofa bed out and cot bed up. Our beds were comfortable, the carpet was luxuriously thick and the bathroom whilst being small had everything we needed and was of a high standard. The Sony tablet giving free Internet connection was a nice touch. We found getting into central London easy, even with a pram. It's a very short walk to the DLR at excel, where you change for the tube at canning town. After a busy day in the city centre it was actually really nice to escape the crowds and return to the fresh air and open spaces that the docklands area offers. In fact, we spent our first day exploring this area rather than heading in to central London as there was plenty to do and places to eat including a little beach area close to the cable car which was really nice, friendly and not over crowded. Parking at the excel seemed safe enough and was £15 for 24 hrs. It is very close to the boat (a much shorter walk than we expected). All in all we were sad to leave. The Sunborn is a wonderful hotel and the bar terrace area in the sunshine was fantastic! You felt like rotalty! We will certainly look to return when we visit London again, especially if we can benefit from the 3 for 2 night offer which we did this time. Only negative... Breakfast was quoted at £19 each (I wasn't offered a price for a child so assume they are charged full?), which is far too expensive for 3 people for 3 mornings, especially with a child who would only eat a bowl of cereal. However, we found some nice cafes near by offering breakfast for a more reasonable price (£3.95 for full english) and we actually prefered having a walk in the morning sunshine. If you want a luxurious bolthole out of the city but close enough to the tube I would 100% recommend the Sunborn. Book it!","en"
"1553",3,"I stayed at the Thanet for a week in December of 2003. My room was a double with a very high ceiling. Inside, the beds were budget, as were most of the in-room ammenities. But as a seasoned traveller, as long as it's safe and clean, I don't care. The heater worked great, which was important in the frigid winter temperatures. The room had one large window that looked out frontwards towards the street. I enjoyed sitting in the window and watching the world pass by. The location of the hotel really was better than I ever imagined. I'd never stayed near Russel Square before, but now I believe it's the place to be. Russel Square itself is lovely, but it's surrounded by a number of large hotels. The Thanet is thankfully tucked about a half-block away. It's close enough to enjoy all the restaurants that cater to the tourists, but far enough away that you never notice the bustle. At the Thanet you are also walking distance from three tube stations and all the busses that run along Oxford st. It is a VERY convenient place to be. Very quiet but also very central. I have usually stayed in west-London, but getting back there (especially late at night) can be a bit expensive. I think my favorite part about the location was its proximity to the British Museum. It is literally around the corner. As the main exhibition halls are free, it was lovely to just stop in on a whim and have a look around whenever I felt like it. Lastly, I found the staff very enjoyable. Richard and his wife are very nice, and the staff from top to bottom was quite polite and friendly. And what you may have read about the breakfast is true. I'm not much of a morning-eater, but I found myself up at the crack of dawn to make it to the breakfast room on time:) In summary, the Thanet is a very nice, clean, quiet hotel in a perfect location. The accomodations are not 'classy' per se, but they are very comfortable and definately reasonable.","en"
"1554",4,"Having never stayed in a Novotel I did not know what to expect but after this trip I would definitely be looking to stay in one again. The room was beautifully decorated and very clean, I especially liked the glass window from the bathroom to the bedroom that frosted over at the touch of a button. Room service was excellent, as was the bar downstairs. Breakfast was on the expensive side but again was very nice. Location-wise, whilst not in central London, it does have a train station right on its doorstep, so traveling into the centre for site seeing or food was very easy.","en"
"1555",5,"Stayed at the Sussex for just one night. I'd emailed in advance to ask for an early check-in and when I arrived at 11:30am on Saturday my room was ready. Very friendly and helpful staff.

Only a couple more minutes to the tube and Hyde Park. Couldn't think of anything to fault at this hotel.","en"

Contrary to ads, they don't arrange theater tickets.","en"

"1558",3,"This hotel was booked for us as a package trip for the 2015 Rugby World Cup. We were 8 men who shared 4 rooms. The rooms are the smallest rooms that I have ever stayed in. This is the only negative about the hotel. The hotel is very well located and we went running in Regent park in the mornings and could walk down to Oxford street later on before the rugby. The breakfast and service is of a high standard. So if you are not going to spend a lot of time in your room then this is good and well located hotel to stay in, in London.","en"
"1559",1,"Wow. Words cannot describe the depths of disappointment I have for my Swine-Town experience. Were I to have been incarcerated in the local jail, I might have had a better night's rest, with probably more living space. My parking space at work is larger than my room was. The room was ridiculously tiny, about 5ft x 8ft with a window that let in every single (let me reitterate - EVERY SINGLE) sound from the road - so I felt like I was sleeping on the Le Mans racetrack at night. (Not beside... ON the bloody racetrack.) The bed was lumpy (asked for a transfer but this hotel was magically ""booked solid"" by other equally masochistic travelers). I'm still itching from what I am sure were bed bugs, who probably thrive in the muggy, fan-free, hot air that is generated by the 4ftx3ft so-called ""bathroom"", which is basically a sink, toilet and shower crammed into a broom closet. Wow. And to think we found a Travelodge Hotel for nearly 35% less just a block away - too late to move... I can't keep writing as its bringing back too many traumatic memories. This is Swinton Cell Inmate 32354 signing off. Two words: Stay Away. STAY AWAY.","en"
"1560",4,"Very helpful staff. We pre-paid for three nights in one-bedroom suite with a balcony. By U.S. standards the suite was tiny, and the balcony miniscule. On the flip side, the bath was huge in comparison to the parlor and bedroom. 'Big soaking tub and a ceiling mounted rainfall shower. The hotel has been re-fitted with the latest in electronics for security and convenience matters. Big flat-screen TV's in the bedroom and parlor; even a smaller one for tub viewing. Appreciated the Nespresso machine, electric kettle, microwave, and mini-fridge stocked daily. Very good experience.","en"
"1561",4,"Every year we go to see a show through the daily mail in London, the hotel is an added bonus as its free. So cost wise very good value £60 to see Billy Elliott and stay in the central park. Very near two tube stations, just around the corner. Very good check in, and the rooms are on the small size, but didnt worry us, we had twin beds. The rooms are nice and warm, and you can turn the temperature to what you wish. Hot water for a bath/shower whenever you wish. Nice clean linen on the beds, and fresh towels, soap, shower cap etc in the bathroom. The road was quite noisey, but on a night time we never heard anything. One thing we didnt like is at 0100 our ajoining neighbours had the tv on loud and were chatting loudly, walls are very thin, shame they never thought about us! There were a few holes here and there, and our room was better than my daughters and family friend. Not a problem for us, as only staying the one night. As with everyone nearly that has taken the time to write on trip advisor, i agree the breakfast is a real let down. They state it is a continental breakfast, er, no way! A continental breakfast should consist of fruit, yogurts, cold meats, croisants etc. The fruit juice were in tiny glasses and very sweet and diluted, there were croisants and toast, cereal,+ thats it! Coffee and tea also supplied. Again as others have stated bacon, egg etc at a price, hardly anyone touched it, but there is a man that puts one rasher on your plate, he gives you your food! Look dry as well. Better to eat out, cheaper and edible. Everywhere was excessible from the central park, and i enjoyed our stay, if the manager were to bother to read what guests write on trip advisor, then maybe they would upgrade breakfasts for free, instead of doing the basic cereals etc, it was so cheap!! No bed bugs to report thank goodness. Yes i would stay again, but Managers need to stop being stingy with breakfast.","en"

"1564",1,"I visit London quite frequently for leisure and booked this hotel as it was close to Hyde Park for ""Winter Wonderland"" and Oxford St for shopping. This is NOT a 4* star hotel & whoever is responsible for awarding 4 stars, needs glasses. Booked a deluxe double room, it was very shabby & not deluxe. When we discussed our concerns with the Duty Manager, we were told ""we are having a refurbishment next year and that the price would be double"" !!!! what's that to do with our complaints now ? Room service was terrible, sandwich looked like it came from a late night corner shop. Our towels stank of fried food & the bath robes were tatty and frayed. Lights above bed wouldn't tun off, had to take the light bulb out every night. I could go on & on, but I have better things to do !! Our room faced the back of The Hilton and on both mornings of our stay we were woken early by dustcarts picking up glass bottles (very noisy) and the hotel rubbish. Don't be fooled by the picture of the outside, that was the best view of the hotel, which does not match the interior. Be warned, don't bother booking, there are far better hotels in the area (I have stayed in them) that truly are 4* and are really deluxe.......","en"

"1571",5,"The excellent service started from the moment I walked through the doors. The person at the front desk first complimented me on the history I had staying at Morgans Group Hotels (it's true). Then, she was apologetic that my original room was not available (I checked in very late after flight delays) and, without prompting, offered to upgrade me to a ""Superior"" room - room 203 to be exact. I was nervous that being on the 2nd floor and overlooking the street would be noisy, but instead it was peaceful and relaxing. I don't know how much more a superior room costs over the deluxe, but it seemed like I was getting something quite nice. The room was LARGE, and not just for boutique hotel standards. The bathroom - with an oversized tub, shelves, walk in closet, separate shower and full vanity sink - was the size of some bedrooms! And the bedroom was generous with a queen bed, desk and TV/mini bar. The bed had the standard St. Martin's Lane color dial lighting over it, which I'm glad they haven't changed over the years. I ordered room service which was prompt and tasty, but ended up being very expensive for what I got. The checkout was quick and they even printed out google maps for me to get to my work location. St. Martin's lane was one of the first design hotels and still sets the standard for what they should be.","en"
"1572",4,"I stayed with my wife and two children for 4 nights. The reception staff were good during check in and check out. Had breakfast in the hotel and having the same menu for 4 mornings were a little boring.

I think night life is not safe as could see Police cars patrolling and frequent siren sounds (don't know whether it was Ambulance or Police) . The exterior window was sealed with foam strip as I think the window coudn't be closed due to its age. Was informed over the phone that car parking is first come first served basis. We were lucky to get a car parking space on Friday night (reached around 8:30pm ) but was informed not to take out the car as we may not get the parking space again.

So we opened the window and lived with street noise. The hotel sort of fixed it the next day. While the system did cool it also gurgled and made noises intermittently throughout the night which made a peaceful night of sleep difficult. Although nicely appointed, the room was smaller than we expected - perhaps our expectations were too high (just a foot wider would have been nice). The bed was on the short side - feet hung off the end. The location was good because it was central London - but then there are lots of hotels in central London this can be said for.","en"

"1577",5,"We stayed for 8 nights in the apartments offered by Rubens at the palace. We traveled with our 4 children, my husband and myself, and my inlaws. We needed the space and the apartments were the perfect option. They were a few blocks from the actual hotel, but still close enough to walk there when we needed the concierge. Here are some pros and cons: Pros: Apartment space was great Loved having a washer/dryer Clean and neat Ability to eat in the room on the days the kids were exhausted Great location- close to so much Cons: Hotel restaurant wasn't easily accessible Only one toilet in the 2 bedroom apt. Keys were a nightmare to use- three of them to get into the apartment and none of them ever worked the first time Food in London is just ok- my poor kids just wanted a grilled cheese sandwich and a lemonade without carbonation-although this has nothing to do with the Rubens.

"1585",3,"We were staying just one night following a dinner at The Royal Horseguards - now that IS a great hotel and a favourite of mine. Unfortunately, the best rate there was on offer was over £240, so we decided to stay here as it looked so great on their web site. We had booked a superior room with breakfast for £175 and, on arrival, were delighted to learn that we were being up-graded to one of their premier Club Rooms. When we opened the door we were amazed at its ""rabbit hutch"" size. Everything looked nice, but oh so claustrophobic. The shower room was remarkable. You could not stand anywhere in the shower cubicle without the shower curtain hanging against your body (and I'm thin). The toilet pedestal was also very cleverly located in a tiny corner by the shower and with the wash-hand basin directly in front. Quite novel - going to the loo and washing your hands at the same time. In this quality (price) hotel, you also expect some decent soap, shower gel and shampoo, not something non-descript, bearing the hotel group's name. and 'Made in China' on the bottles. Bed softness/hardness is mostly a personal preference, but ours was hard, high up and with excruciatingly solid polyester-filled pillows. Why oh why can't hotels get right the fundamental reason for staying with them i.e. a good night's sleep, like being at home? Our Club room (#214) faced out over the back yard to the Westminster Council-operated car park. That was fun, with all the comings and goings. Finally, our room had ceiling to floor sloping windows, each with semi-opaque fabric concertina blinds (you know, the sort you put in conservatories to cut down the sun). Well they weren't much use at cutting out the external light, so our room remained well illuminated and contributed to our fairly sleepless night. Breakfast - absolutely nothing of real quality here - fruit juice, cereals, TINNED fruit salad, and for the cooked option - soggy bacon (I hate this and Americans won't tolerate non-crispy bacon), gristly sausage, a fried potato triangle, over-cooked baked beans and rubberised scrambled egg. The croissants were stale. Not quite the ""greasy spoon"" but far short of what should be be provided. My advice, if you want a superlative short stay in London. is don't even consider this place (unless you are a very small person). Row out the boat a bit and go to the Royal Horseguards, where we should have stayed again.","en"
"1586",2,"Stayed for my partners 50th, what a disappointment. This hotel is not a 3* hotel. If they got the 3rd star for the net curtains they could at least clean them. They were so dirty aand grey could not see through them. There are no tea and coffee facilities in the room which I have had at guesthouses and 2* hotels in London. . If you have already booked ensure you request not to stay in room 335 it is tiny, dark, smells and there is mould all over the wall on the right hand side of the bed. The only good thing is they changed our room without hesitation, although as they were full I felt sorry for the people who did have to stay in it. This hotel is overpriced and you can stay in far better of quite a lot less. I booked it and was willing to pay more as the reviews were good I couldn't have been more room. I did not stay long enough to experience the hospitality.","en"
"1587",5,"Most people look forward to a weekend away, but having to spend your weekend away working is never something to look forward to. So the perfectly located and well oiled machine that is the Sloane Square Hotel, made my weekend more than just bearable. For starters I would have no problem staying here for pleasure as well as business, but the room isn't huge, so for a couple staying more than a couple of nights it might be a little on the small side. However, for a solitary business traveller it was the perfect place. Spotlessly clean, modern, well equipped and with a very comfortable bed and free wifi, I was delighted with the accommodation. As for the rest of the hotel, I never used any of the other facilities and I ate in the gorgeous Sloane Square. However, the check in was very efficient, staff very courteous and friendly and I would strongly recommend this hotel.","en"

I have stayed in many hotels in London, and Dukes is a real jewel.

Once our desires are expressed, the staff is very willing to comply if possible.","en"

"1596",4,"We liked this hotel a lot. Obviously, location is its best asset. The rooms are bright and fresh but tiny. Very clean. But a bit noisy including staff cleaning the rooms in the morning. We liked the media add-on which meant we could watch TV but the bathroom add-on mostly involved the bath towels. The supposed toiletries were a small tube of shower get for both of us for 2 nights... There was no shampoo. If you are staying for longer than 2 nights definitely you need to buy the room-cleaning add-on, as the dust creeps out of everywhere like you couldn't believe. There is no breakfast or restaurant in this hotel but it is not necessary, as there are plenty of options in St Pancras station nearby. All in all, I would gladly book this hotel again. There some local attractions too, like the Charles Dickens Museum, British Library and Old St Pancras Church, which is literally behind the station and unbelievably quiet.","en"

"1598",4,"Stayed here twice. Paddington is a good base specially if you’re taking the Heathrow Express, this hotel is only a 5 minute walk from the train station and the metro. There are a few generic places around to eat, but coming back late is not a problem this area is pretty safe. You can walk to Hyde Park easily. Check in and out was fast and efficient, everything feels a little small, including the room(you can hear everything that’s going on in the hallway) but the décor is pretty stylish and modern. Overall is a little pricy for what you get but that’s London for you.","en"
"1599",4,"Booked this hotel with only a couple of days notice for 2 nights. Total price much less than many other hotels were offering for one night! Requested a quieter room if possible due to long day traveling and not feeling 100%. This request was listened to by the very kind receptionist whom also explained breakfast etc. Off up to floor 5 I went, up here I could still feel the effects of the underground/building work however it was quiet for central London. Room was newly renovated and the bed was amazing. I agree with some follow reviews that the heat in the building is a tad warm however there was a fan in the room. All the basics expected in a Travelodge were provided, this is probably the nicest Travelodge I have stayed in to date! I had my evening meal here on the first night.. NEVER AGAIN. I waited over an hour for my starter which was pretty awful, the menu would have had more texture and taste. Main course followed around 20 minutes later, by this point it was almost 8:00 so really the moment had passed. I ordered some chips with my curry, a small bowl of 12 chips costing almost £2.50, outrageous! So for sub-standard 'microwave meals' with poor staff look no further. I did attempt to make a comment about this on check out however the receptionist was very busy and had many customers to deal with so I didn't enter discussions on the matter. For decent food try somewhere else, many good pubs and or chains near by, take a walk after all it is London! Location of the hotel very good, everything is on the doorstep! Breakfast however was the standard hotel food you would expect, not a complaint to be made from me about this element. Would certainly stay here again but would not eat evening meals here.","en"

"1601",5,"I really can't recommend this place enough. The staff were so accommodating and friendly, and the venue itself is very modern, spotlessly clean and the room was really, really nice. Lots of modern features, a nice sized bed (we had a large room), but still absolutely amazing value for money! I've been in four star hotels that weren't as good as this! I'd go back any time I visit London, as the location is great too, right next to Shoreditch.","en"
"1602",5,"We spent 3 nights at the Rosewood and had a great time. We checked in around 9 pm, very easy and professional check in. We ask the concierge to help us find a near by Indian restaurant and they called and made us reservations at a great spot about a 5 minute walk away. We also used the concierge to help us on our return to the airport. We left our luggage with them in the morning and a car picked us up with our luggage later in the day at another location, worked out perfectly. The room was very nice, bed was excellent. The lights in the room were a little tricky to figure out, but we got the hang of it quickly. We went to Scarfes Bar twice and had a great time, highly recommend stopping in for a drink...or two. We had breakfast twice and both times the quality and the service were excellent. I thought the location was good, we walked everywhere. Overall a very good experience.","en"
"1603",4,"We had the pleasure of staying here for one night this weekend - our first visit to Browns. Our welcome was great - excellent concierge who introduced himself to us(George) and good check in. We were taken to our room and left to settle into our Executive room. We then realised we were overlooking the inner workings of the hotel which was pretty grim. We asked to move and decided to upgrade to a more expensive Deluxe room (205) for a street outlook. It was great with plenty of light/windows. However we were a little disappointed (hence the 4 star and not 5) as on their web it says we would have a double sink, separate shower and walk in wardrobe. We didn't have any of those and the shower was not great and water was only warm not hot - bathroom needed an upgrade we thought. Bed the most comfortable ever though! However saying that - we really enjoyed our stay and it was made very special by the lovely staff who were genuinely kind and really cared that we enjoyed our stay. Sunday lunch was excellent and the roast was superb as was the atmosphere in the Donavan Bar. The bar snacks were fab too. A special mention to whoever does the flowers! My husband had arranged for flowers in the room - beautiful!! Really quite stunning and re packed for us on departure.","en"
"1604",5,"Stayed here four times this year. Lovely quiet rooms, modern stylish decor, free internet. The layout of this hotel means the cheaper rooms are looking into the atrium, and as this is in a 'V' shape, your window can be only a few metres from the opposite window. This means that many people can look directly into your room when the curtains are open, or when you have the lights on at night. That's about the only downside. The outside rooms are better, and many of them are 'studios' with a small living area which has a double sofa bed, a kitchenette with microwave, sink, and some eating utensils. The bathroom is stylish with a large deep bath and separate shower. I found the pillows to be very soft and flat, perhaps there is a pillow menu - I didn't ask. There is a cafe in the lobby serving Illy coffee. The hotel is about 5 minutes walk from the London eye, and directly across Westminster bridge from the houses of parliament. Just far enough away from the tourist crowds, but close enough to walk into the centre of London, or take a bus from outside the hotel.","en"
"1605",4,"A good hotel, nice and quiet despite being near a busy(ish) road and very helpful/friendly staff. My only issue was the bathroom, we had the disable friendly one, which left the whole bathroom soaked for hours after a shower. Had to keep taking my socks off to get to the toilet!","en"

"1608",5,"This was our first trip to London and we chose this hotel because of The reviews on ""Trip Advisor"" and because it is a Marriott property. We arrived shortly after midnight after a long day of traveling from Ohio. The desk attendants greeted us as if we were old friends. They made us feel very welcome at the hotel. Our room on the sixth floor was clean and comfortable. The air conditioning worked well. The three gentleman who alternated working at the concierge desk when we were there treated us with patience and kindness. They answered all of my questions. They never tired of my asking questions either (and I asked a lot). They arranged for car service to take us to Heathrow airport when we left. The price they obtained was much less than I could have arranged on my own. If you are driving, the hotel may seem to be far from central London or Westminister. However, this hotel has close proximity to the Swiss Cottage underground station. You can be anywhere in the London/Westminister area within about 15-20 minutes from the time you leave the hotel. Yes, lodging in London is expensive! However, this is a friendly and clean hotel that is conveniently located. The staff is wonderful, and I do believe you receive value for what you spend on the room at this hotel. I will stay here again when I return to London.","en"
"1609",4,"My partner and I recently stayed at The Montcalm to celebrate his 50th birthday. We were pleasantly surprised by the friendly reception upon our arrival and consequent stay at the hotel. The room was well equipped and extremely comfortable. The contemporary feel and finishings added to the enjoyment of our stay. It is unfortunate that some of the fittings were a little 'tired' and in need of repair, particularly the loose fittings on the bath which proved frustrating when emptying and filling. Apart from these minor details,everything else was presented to a high standard. The staff should be highly commended,ensuring that we were happy and comfortable. Thank you for your warm hospitality and friendly approach. The location is great too. Close your eyes as you walk through the Barbican tunnel and enjoy the splendours of Smithfield market and its lovely restaurants. A great location on the doorstep of the Montcalm. Overall,a great location with wonderful staff. Thank you for a relaxing weekend stay.","en"
"1610",5,"We stayed here on Saturday to celebrate our wedding anniversary. We go there before check in time & they kindly took our luggage to our room whilst we went into London for the day. As we were there celebrating they upgraded our room & also sent up some macaroons, which was lovely! We stayed in the Virginia Woolfe room, which had a lovely separate living room area. The bed was really comfy & it had a big bath. All the staff were really friendly. The breakfast was one of the best i've ever had in a hotel. Lots to choose from. I would definitely stay here again if I was in the area.","en"
"1611",4,"I stayed here for two nights recently, and found that the hotel pretty much hit my needs. There was some small delay with checking-in, which is never good when you arrive at 10pm and just want to get to your room, but otherwise the staff seemed efficient and friendly. The rooms were comfortable, clean. Breakfast was included, but a little basic. When busy, the staff also seemed to find it hard to keep the breakfast bar replenished meaning people were waiting around for new stock, blocking others. The coffee was also quite nasty. My biggest complaints: the fact that there is only one, small lift means that it can take quite some time for it to arrive and when it does, it's often full - or there is a queue in the lobby for it. When on a high floor, this becomes quite a nuisance. The pricing of internet access is also too high - many other HI Express' have free wifi, yet this and the HI Express Earls Court (owned by the same franchisee) seems to charge quite a high price. I'd stay here again, but it's the small things that make an ""ok"" hotel into a great hotel, and with a few tweaks, this could be so much better.","en"
"1612",4,"When you check into a Premier Inn you're informed that they guarantee a good night's sleep and that's what Premier Inn Tower Hill delivers.

We'd definitely go there again","en"
"1613",5,"We were given a room on the second floor overlooking Norfolk Square and fronting on to London Street. The standards of the room really do justify a 4 star AA rating.

"1616",5,"I stayed two nights at the Stafford on May 8 & 9, 2007. This was my first stay although I had visited the hotel and looked at a sampling of rooms in 2006. The first night I stayed in a deluxe junior suite in the main building and the second night in a deluxe junior suite in the new mews building that had only been open one week. Both rooms were large, comfortable and quiet. I preferred the mews suite because of its nicer bath and newness. My main building room was in the rear and was extremely quiet. It had a separate sitting room with a good reading lamp. The bath was fairly small, but had a separate shower. The room was furnished traditionally with king bed, chair and sofa. Actually, both rooms had two twin beds pushed together to form a king which I found satisfactory. My mews room was on the rear of that building overlooking the Park Place cul-de-sac. It had one large room with a sitting area at one end with only a loveseat--no upholstered chair. The TV was flat panel, wide-screen, whereas the main building room had an older conventional TV. There was some street noise, but it was muffled and acceptable to me. The bath was huge with two sinks, a separate shower and heated tile floor. The Stafford is excellently located a short walk through the park from the Green Park tube station. There are many nearby restaurants on and near Piccadilly. It is walking distance to many attractions, including the theater district. The general neighborhood in nice and upscale. A laptop is on a table in the lobby for free guest use and was almost always available when I wanted to use it. Breakfasts were very good--from the menu--no buffet--in the attractive restaurant. I had dinner one night in the New American Bar and enjoyed it. I didn't eat dinner in the more upscale restaurant. Overall, I found the Stafford to be a very pleasant place to stay and will stay there again. I would classify it as a 5-star hotel.","en"
"1617",1,"stayed at the Princes Square for the 6th time and again, everything was ok. Just don't expect too much of it and you'll be fine. Rooms are generally small, but adequate, and above all, very clean. True, some rooms look a bit dated, bathroom can be really tiny (although some rooms have bigger ones), remotes don't always work, or aren't there at all, but in my opinion, this isn't essential for a good stay. Breakfast was the best we had in 6 years and for the first time, the breakfast room wasn't busy at all! And the location is perfect. A quiet neighbourhood but only a few minutes away from Bayswater tube station. All in all, a nice place to stay.","en"
"1618",5,"I booked the Anpersand after seeing the hotel on Mr & Mrs Smith. Like all the other hotels on there we weren't disappointed. Staff were lovely and the room was exquisite.

"1620",3,"Rooms here are pretty much what you would expect from an Ibis; basic, but clean functional, and comfortable. Room was a reasonable size for London, the bed and bedding were comfortable, and it was nice to have a full length bath with a shower above. Of particular note are the restaurant and bar on site. The bar especially has a nice old English pub feel to it, and it serves nice food which is reasonably priced. Finally, the location. If you are visiting the Earls Court Arena this is absolutely ideal as you are right on the doorstep. There are also some very nice restaurants along the road, and the nearest tube station (West Brompton) allows quite easy access to the rest of London.","en"

"1623",5,"I like this hotel. The prices are very reasonable for a good quality accommodation in London.. Stayed there twice now in the last year. Its quiet on Chiltern St. I always have a room looking out there on the 2nd floor. The guest rooms are smaller than other places outside of London that you might stay at but hey its London, your not going to be spending time in your room except to sleep. The one downside is probably the lift, its quite possibly the smallest i've ever been in. 2 people and 2 cases is all it can handle but it gets you where you want to be. The staff are very friendly and helpful which always helps too. Breakfast is good with plenty of choice (for me) with proper bacon!! something i miss greatly being a Brit living in the US. And work a deal out with them to get the wi-fi free. It can be done. One downside is the getting of a new username and password every 24hrs but i believe that can be extended too Another downside is the thin single pane windows. It was snowing when we were there and the person closest to the window felt it a few degrees colder than the person on the other side of the bed. You can actually see the breeze blowing the curtains Great location just up from Oxford St and Baker St Tube.Starbucks is close by as is a Tescos supermarket. I think the Blandford is really a 4.5 in my book for good value, comfortable accommodation in London, but i like the place so i'll give it 5.. All in all very good and i'll be back","en"

Minutes from Euston Station and St Pancreas Station and Bus stops. We arrived from Scotland by train. Caught the train to Paris during our stay. Leaving we caught the underground direct to Heathrow. Most of the staff was friendly and helpful. I thought it was good value for money and we would stay there again.","en"
"1628",4,"We booked a family room for 5. Poor service on reception. Whilst we could have left bags there, they were not secure. The room was a normal height room with split level. Therefore the three beds on the mezzanine were impossible to stand near, you had to crawl to bed and be careful not to whack your head when you woke up. the tv was in the corner and only in sight of those crawling up the stairs. Breakfast was vile. I drank a cup of tea. It was tomatoes, cucumber, some cereal and badly cooked eggs. You had to queue for a long time and squash into the breakfast room.","en"
"1629",5,"I often stay here when in London on business. The location is good and it's comfortable enough but there is a lot of room for improvement. Dealing with the staff feels like dealing with a call centre - they're well trained and generally polite but totally cold and impersonal and don't give the impression that they really care at all. The rooms are modern and stylish but tend to be rather noisy. Some of this is unavoidable traffic noise from outside which I can understand but lots of it is internal noise - every door opening and closing along the corridor seems to be audible. In the studio room I go for there are two large TV's with lots of channels - which sounds great except that the TV distribution system in the hotel is so poor that the picture is invariably blocky, jerky and entirely unwatchable. I've complained about this on a number of occassions but it's a systemic issue and, as is typical of PP, I don't get the impression that anyone cares. It's a very big, very busy hotel and gives off the impression that as long as it's busy no one particularly cares about the finer details of the guest experience. So if you're on business and just want a half-decent room in a good location then I'd recommend it. For a personal trip I would never stay here.","en"

When I felt better, the service at the restaurants and bars was great.

We got a great deal through travelzoo which included breakfast and a bottle of the house red wine which was presented to us at checkin.

All the staff were extremely polite and helpful. Views from the bar and restaurants are unbelievable as was the view from the luxurious room. I would recommend to any body a truly unbelievable experience and a superb location. Many thanks for making my wife's birthday an unforgettable experience.","en"
"1638",2,"Having recently spent a few nights in the Best Western in Paris my expectations were set. However, this Best Western disappoints as it is not up to the usual Beat Western standards. Room card keys mysteriously lost their room after the third day and every day thereafter. Front desk not very helpful in resolving issue. For a breakfast, forget it and do yourself a favour, go out and enjoy a good breakfast nearby. The bread and rolls must be a few days old, impossible to eat. Rooms are tiny and if you are not used to sleeping on a double bed be prepared for some sleepless nights. It is true what they say about not being able to swing a dead cat in these rooms. A tip, book into the Crowne Plaza next door or Holiday inn across the road. What was a great trip to London is made very average by this hotel. Not up to the usual Best Western standards, come on guys, you need to do something to improve this hotel as it gives Best Western a bad name.","en"
"1639",5,"I don't normally write reviews but this was really quite unexpectedly a very nice experience. For a reasonable price (esp in terms of London standards) we got a nice renovated room and super helpful staff - esp. Witek and weronika but everybody really was effortlessly customer oriented. As the hotel is well located not too far from the shopping and also well connected public transport wise (or when its four of you it costs less to take a taxi to the tourist centre) we will be back!","en"
"1640",4,"Used this hotel for a group with private dining and meeting space. Food and service were great. The lobby is gorgeous and the location can't be beat. Scotland Yard is next door and Westminster Abbey is a few blocks away. The rooms are very small. Three suits will fit in the closet. The sink is tiny with a few inches of room to store toiletries. I got the ""deluxe"" room so I can't imagine what a non-deluxe room would look like. Advice to the hotel, at least put in a coat hook somewhere to hang a jacket. There is NO room for luggage or anything else in the room.","en"

The staff were excellent - really helpful, and courteous - and they jumped on the internet when they couldn't answer any question. Continental breakfast was fabulous - a great way to start each day. Only about a two minute walk to Barbican station on the Underground, but also close enough to central London that you can walk to all the main tourist sites if you're reasonably fit (and like walking).","en"
"1643",1,"My family paid for my husband and myself to stay in the hotel with an evening meal and go to a show in April this year. We were told that everything was planned to the finest detail and we just had to turn up at the right times. We arrived at about three and went to our room. A twin was booked but we were given a double (1st problem). We were in the room for only 10 minutes when the maintenance man called to fix a tile in the bathroom. Neither us nor the maintenance man could find where the broken tile was so he left, but ten minutes later he returned with strict instructions to find the broken tile and fix it. He left after five minutes without doing anything (2nd problem). The show we were going to started at seven thirty so we booked a taxi for six forty five. We then booked a table in the hotel restaurant for five o'clock, giving us plenty of time to eat our three course meal then get changed for the show. When we arrived at the restaurant we were told that it didn't start serving until five thirty! (3rd problem) We returned at five thirty to an empty restaurant but didn't get our meal until six fifteen! We didn't have time for a starter or pudding so we just had the main course. We arrived at the concierge desk at six forty five to wait for our pre ordered taxi, which the concierge said was on it's way. It did not arrive until five past seven (4th problem). We went to breakfast and was given a pot of coffee, but no cups and saucers (5th problem). I had to ask. After breakfast we returned to our room. Even though we didn't have to vacate until 1200hrs we had a cleaner bang on our door three times to get in to clean (6th problem). We decided to leave early and get away from this awful place. Although the complaints on their own are only minor, when you add them up it becomes a real problem. We did complain to the reception desk but felt that they were only paying us lipservice. We were looking forward to a break in London but ended up having the most stressful time ever and will not be coming back!","en"

"1645",5,"Booked fo 2 nights in a de luxe room last week. Selected hotel on basis of good reviews and proximity to Royal Festival hall during tube strike. We were a bit disappointed in the size of the room - we thought it would be larger but the bathroom was big but the room and bathroom were nicely appointed in high quality furniture /fittings. However we had a string of problems with the lighting, first the bathroom lights would not switch off and after the technician had fixed those we found it had upset something else because when we went to bed the bedroom lights would not switch off. A technician was sent again but to put the bedroom lights off he had to disable the bathroom lights completely - a bit of a fiasco. The following morning on the way to breakfast (which was excellent) I left a note for the Duty Manger detailing the problems , when we went back to the room after breakfast the Duty Manager (Mr Arbona) had already responded. He offered us an immediate move to a suite which he took us to within 5 minutes. When we returned to the suite after lunch there was champagne , chocolates and fruit waiting for us. So I have given the Corinthia 5 out of 5 despite the lighting problems because of Mr Arbonas swift response as soon as he was made aware of the problem. I can also say that we found all the staff extremely helpful and friendly - especially the doormen.The public areas of the hotel especially the lounge and indoor garden were both comfortable and elegant.","en"
"1646",3,"The building itself is rather striking, and I suspect has been used in the tv series ""Poirot"" for its 1930s architecture. I was surprised to be asked for my passport: that would be unusual for a British hotel - the owners are Spanish, I think, and maybe this is why? The lifts are a bit confusing: there is a panel on the wall a few feet away, you put the floor number in there, and it directs you to the appropriate lift (A, B, C or D). OK once you are used to it.... I had a room facing into the centre of the hotel: would definitely not choose for the view, but was very quiet. As usual for London, the rooms are small: 2 people sharing would struggle. The dark furniture & colour scheme made it somewhat oppressive too. The bathroom was tiny, but had everything required. Wifi was free and fast. Housekeeping top-rate. The location is excellent: across the road from Great Portland Street tube, round the corner from Regent's Park, close to University College.","en"
"1647",4,"Used a comparison web-site and found, what seemed a good deal, 1 night b'n'b in a named hotel close to the tube and many great locations. Got there and found my room on the reservation form had been changed and we'd been allocated a different room. I was shocked by the room. Opening the door it almost touched the bed. barely enough room to circumnavigate the bed to get to the shower room or the other side. No room to sit if you pulled out the chair from the desk and no other seating in the room as no space. The bed was a small double. This double room was at best, a single room with a small double bed shoe horned in. I immediately requested a change and asked if there was something I could upgrade to and pay the difference. Apparently the hotel was full. I questioned the change and asked about the original room. Apparently it was just as small. I requested an ironing board and received a small version, just as well, which I managed to put up, half in the bedroom and half in the shower room. Next morning there was no hot water. I called reception and was advised I was not the only one to complain. The boiler had cut out and was being re-set. My partner still had no hot water two hours later. Breakfast was mediocre at best. Quality of fixtures, fittings and furnishings very good and staff very friendly throughout the whole inadequate experience. I won't be back and suggest you book with caution.","en"

Also loved the fact you could still have air con even in the winter.Beds are so comfy I wanted to bring it home!!! I would def stay here again if I ever visit London again.","en"
"1651",4,"I have stayed at this hotel many times and normally am very impressed, this time though the room we were put in was a little under the weather (shower was a trickle at best and TV kept playing up).

Overall though this is a really nice hotel with friendly staff and a great location, 5 minutes walk from Gloucester Road tube station.","en"
"1652",5,"My client suggested this hotel, which is not that far (15 minute walk) to their office. I took a taxi and recognized the hotel as a form Jury's Inn that I'd stayed at a couple of years earlier. My heart sunk as I remembered the former hotel. Dark, tired room, gym wasn't available, good breakfast. You have to carry your bags from the street up to the lobby level to check in. It was a hotel I wouldn't have stayed at again. The lobby seemed to have been upgraded so I asked the woman at reception who said that they whole hotel had been given a renovation. This room was better than the one I remember (probably refreshed) and the gym is now available. The good news: Internet and breakfast were part of the room rate. However, the room was still pretty dark (a common failing of hotels) and the water in the bathroom was lukewarm at the tops. I asked if this could be fixed and it was. The breakfast was identical to the one I'd had at the Jury's version. Internet didn't work immediately and I called the front desk. A manage was going to come by, but it started working as I played with it. The internet was wired and not wifi, which is not a big issue. I needed to print something out. There was a printer downstairs in the lobby. The internet connection on that was the speed of molasses and the printer ran out of ink while I was printing. The Bloomsbury is not a bad hotel, but it does not in my mind match the reviews it is getting. I'd probably try another area hotel before staying here to see which was better.","en"

Great location for us -- it was 2 blocks walk to Waterloo station and just slightly more than that to Westminster Bridge. The London Eye and the Aquarium are right there.","en"
"1655",5,"Considering the price, quality and location of this hotel, it’s hard to beat. As the name suggests it’s located right in the centre of Temple Court, just a few minutes walk west up Fleet Street from Ludgate Circus and City Thameslink station or a few minutes walk east down Fleet Street from Covent Garden and Aldwych. It’s a fascinating area full of historic buildings (Royal Courts of Justice, Temple Church, the Old Bank of England etc.) and several pubs, cafes and restaurants. The area between the hotel and the Thames is particularly interesting, full of old lawyers offices, peaceful squares and quirky buildings. It’s less than 10 minutes walk to Covent Garden and there are direct trains from Gatwick airport to the City Thameslink station. The hotel itself is set slightly back from Fleet Street, so it’s very quiet for a central London hotel, and it’s spread out over three sides of a courtyard, so you can risk quite a walk to your room if it’s located, as ours was, on the far side. This wasn’t an issue for us at all, but of you have a lot of luggage you might want to use the porter service. Reception service was efficient and professional (they were able to meet our modest last minute requests with the minimum of fuss), and the area around the lobby, which includes the bar and breakfast area, was cosy and comfortable. Our room was excellent. It was a standard room on the third floor with a courtyard view and, unless you really need extra space or a specific view, I really can’t see a need to upgrade. It’s relatively small but has everything you need, and more. We had a large and very comfortable bed, TV, tea and coffee making facilities, dressing table, spacious cupboard with safe etc and a huge bathroom, almost as big as the bedroom itself, with bath, separate shower, some classy toiletries and, most important of all, the Apex rubber duck! As other reviewers have mentioned, Fleet Street is relatively quiet at weekends, so be aware that a few of the local wine bars may not be open all day, but there again, you are only ten minutes from Covent Garden, which is buzzing 24/7. In fact, we really enjoyed the relatively quiet location after a busy day of shopping and sightseeing. You can usually get a good deal for this hotel on all the standard websites. It’s a top class hotel in a great location so I will definitely recommend it, particularly if the price is right.","en"
"1656",3,"Great large hotel with great views from the top floor. Rooms are small but nice, wooden beds with TV and coffee / tea facilities. Powerfull shower and bath was spacious. Staff friendly and a nice bar on the first floor not open too late though. There was a small coffee bar and alcohol in the spacious reception. Would recommend.","en"
"1657",5,"We stayed here last night and agree with everyone who has said it is a beautiful hotel. However when I book a hotel at this price, I expect them to get the basics right and have a touch of luxury and style o top. Here they have the latter but one of the basics is missing. We had a terrible nights sleep because of the sound proofing. I was initially worried about the street outside but it was the flimsy ceilings and floors inside that I should have been worried about. The room upstairs from us decided to start packing at about 2am and all we heard for the next 2 hours was them plodding heavily about. We eventually went and complained as they didn't appear to be going to bed anytime soon. The manager said sorry but as way of explanation said that the couple were checking out early. Surely that happens quite alot in hotels hence why it's important to have designed your rooms not to hear it?","en"

King room was as much or more space as we needed. Rooms are clean and modern. There were plenty of electrical outlets for our needs. Did not try lunch or dinner at the restaurant but a better breakfast can be had by walking down toward Bayswater to a little hole in the wall restaurant on the right (by the 2nd Greek Restaurant). Hotel is in a good, quiet neighborhood about half-way between Queensway and Lancaster Gate tube stations. We would definitely stay here again.","en"
"1660",5,"Beautiful hotel in a great location next to Marylebone station. The Winter Garden restaurant is perfect for afternoon tea with a soaring atrium, palm trees and a pianist playing up on the mezzanine. The staff, especially Kati, were kind, efficient and helpful. The food was excellent and the sandwiches just kept on coming! Cakes for which we just had no room left were put in a stylish carry home box. It was a perfect end to a lovely day in London and although probably not the cheapest afternoon tea in London, we felt it was excellent value. Thank you.","en"

We bought our Tower of London tickets in the Lobby and were able to skip the huge ticket line at the Tower. The water pressure in the showers was great and there was plenty of hot water (be careful it gets VERY hot!) Free wifi at McDonalds across from the tube.","en"
"1662",5,"I recently proposed to my girlfriend in Paris and as part of the surprise I booked an ovvernight stay in this hotel with a view to selecting the ring the next day. I selected the hotel via a combination of using the reviews on this site, the location which was ideal for the travel we had planned the next day and also as we live in Manchester I took this as a sign that I should go with this hotel. I no doubt could have chosen one of a number, but I could not have chosen better and I definitely had fortune on my side this particular weekend (starting with the yes I got in Paris!) The eurostar was late due to a light dusting of snow (standard!) so we did not arrive until 9 and I had booked a meal at the hotel restaurant for that time. Upon arrival the staff were extremely friendly and courteous and despite being late (and keeping the chef waiting as we were the last booking of the night) nothing was to much trouble. Upon dropping our stuff off at the room (which was amazing btw) there was a complimentary bottle of proseco for us to toast the occassion, again this didn't have to be done, but really elevated the whole weekend which by this point was going better than I had hoped really. We then spruced up and went down for the meal. Again given teh time (circa 930 by this point) the atmosphere was very relaxed and no one was rushing us etc and again the staff were exceptionally well mannered and professional. The food arrived and was really nice and good value for money, having considered eating out I was happy with the decision to stay in house and by this point was smugness personified as my other half was amazed that the most disorganised man she knows had selected such a good place. After the meal we went back to the room, which was top notch in every way, toasted our engagement and had an amazing nights sleep which I needed desperately as the few prior to popping the question had been terrible. Downside of the bed was that it was much more comfortable and luxurious than the one at our apartment, so now all sleeps (and beds) are compared to the one at the hotel and fall short (not there fault really and no doubt a new bed is probably on the ever growing list of things to spend my money on these days). Next day we arose and checked out and left our bags with the concierge and again another member of staff who was impeccable and a credit to the hotel. The ring was bought (massively over my initial budget - standard) and upon returning to pick our bags up (a bit paler and poorer) the staff were very helpful and offered to arrange a taxi without prompt (although we walked as I needed the fresh air at this time). All in all Paris went exactly to plan and I did not really give the London part much thought other than hoping it was a nice hotel that did not detract from the overall experience, I had not really given much consideration that a one night stop off would affect the overall experience a great deal, however, I am happy to say that the stay, the meal, the staff, the little extra touches throughout really made this a perfect weekend and one that me and my partner will be harping on about for years to come. No doubt future trips to London will now be in the Hotel and no doubt any anniversary/shopping trips in the future will also be here. Whilst not the most articulate of people (no doubt the above is rife with typos) all I can say is a huge thank you to this hotel and the people that make it and say that anyone reading this would be foolish to go elsewhere.","en"
"1663",3,"The best : Clean studio, not big, but large and confortable enough for two px, if you just want to sleep, have a shower and eat some simple meals; quiet residencial area, lovely and cosy victorian buildings, helpful staff; supermarkets and places to have breakfast and all kind of meals, tube and bus - everything just there, at Gloucester Road; also near to some of the most interesting museums (specially for children). Quite central. The «could be better»: The studio (the building as a matter of fact) was quite hot, and there are no condicionated air - however, a fan is provided; the shower water was not always hot enough - but as it was a hot summer, we couldn´t care less. Just make sure you have a plastic cap with you, if you don´t intend to wash your hair every day. The bathroom and the kitchenet were both tiny, which was not really a problem for us. No lifts, but the staff are kind enough to offer to help you with your luggage,if you need. The «happy end»: It´s a perfect good value, and we just loved to stay there!","en"

"1668",1,"Unpleasant, shabby guestrooms and bathrooms: this place needs a major rehaul. As some of the other reviewers mentioned, it's far from clear where this hotel gets its three star rating from. When I checked in after a long day on the UK railway system, I couldn't even get into my room as there was a lot of construction work going on in the corridor. The bar/lounge is pleasant, but have a look at the bottles behind the bar and ignore the drinks list that's on the table: I found that roughly half of the drinks I was interested in, was unavailable. No Grolsch, no Glenmorangie, not a single drop of brandy. The Calvados that I chose after the third ""no"" was generous :-) The good news is that it's very close to Euston Station and that there's a very good Nepalese restaurant within walking distance. The Indian place around the corner is average.","en"

"1670",5,"The whole family (four of us) stayed at Windermere Hotel in London for two nights (13th and 14th of July 2012) on a bed & breakfast basis. We occupied the family suite which consists of rooms No 32 & 33 that are interconnected. The hotel was recently renovated from the ground up; everything was in top-notch condition and the smell of newness still lingered in the rooms. The rooms were very clean, spacious, fully equipped with everything in them functioning properly. Also, there was free Wi-Fi at all floors. The hotel staff, including the owners, were courteous and helpful at all times, oozing professionalism in their approach. Food and service at the dining room were excellent. No wonder the hotel has won several tourist awards over the years. Location-wise, the hotel is strategically situated for shopping and sightseeing – it is only about a ten minute walk from the Victoria Train Station. All-in-all we had an excellent stay at Windermere Hotel; we will go there again and strongly recommend it to anyone looking for comfortable, trouble-free accommodation close to London’s main tourist sites and underground/train network.","en"
"1671",4,"We booked in to stay at the Rhodes from Sunday to Thursday and although the website looks good the actual hotel is somewhat different. There were refurbishment works going on and timbers, bathroom fittings littered the reception and hallways. The breakfast itself was very basic continental unless you wanted to pay an extra £6 for full english, Tea and Coffee was available together with a small selection of fruit, toast, cheese, ham and cereal. Having paid for what we thought was bed and breakfast we did not want to shell out another £50 for the 4 days for breakfast and feel that it would be better for the hotel to simply up their prices to allow for this. The room itself was very small and the as mentioned by other reviewers the hotel in general is very dated and needing a lot of attention. We did have a major problem with our room in that when we came back from our first day out, the door to the room simply pushed open without the need for the key which I assume was because the cleaner did not shut it properly and may have been the cause of other reviewers issues as there is no security to the hotel and you could simply wander around and enter other rooms if they are left open. We advised the reception manager of this but were left without an apology or an explanation as to what they would do about it, an awkward pause was the extent of the reaction! The owner Mr Crias was friendly with us but I guess as we did not really complain and just wanted to get on with our trip he was going to be amiable enough. All in all a very good location for Hyde Park and Picadilly albeit very much overpriced and not somewhere I would want to stay again in a hurry.","en"

"1673",3,"We checked in as a group for a conference, a pleasure denied until 5pm for no immediately obvious reason. It's their 'policy'. On being given key cards it became clear why. We had all been given the worst rooms in the place. Almost unbelievably in 2016, this hotel has two smoking floors. The 1st and the top. My room, on the 2nd floor, reeked of cigarettes and was beyond tired. So was I. Back at reception, I found most if my colleagues all queuing up again wanting to change rooms. Interestingly, despite being over-sold, they managed to rehouse all of us. My next room, on the 11th floor, wouldn't open with my key cards, so back to reception for me! The long-suffering young man, who had clearly seen quite a bit of this before, cut me keys for a room on the 16th floor, determined to make me happy. I had by then decided I would just go back to my flat in London. On the way up he explained that half of the rooms were refurbished, with the remainder to be done at some point, although management were clearly prioritising profitability. My final room was clean, perfectly OK, if nothing special. Remember, this was newly refurbished, and the shower fittings were loose and coming off the wall. My shampoo and conditioner had both been used and the air conditioning did not work properly. In a new room. Laughably, signs on the wall insist that 'smoking is illegal anywhere in this hotel'. Breakfast was adequate, if shambolic. I will not be going back.","en"

Our room was in the attic of its subsidiary building which is located approx 150 yards from main building. 4 flights of stairs to get to the room with no elevator in the building. There is a porter onsite to help you carry your bags to your room .The room was as expected....basic but you get what you pay for. Can't say the room was clean as there was spots of blood on bed sheets when we arrived apart from that we were happy with our stay.","en"
"1678",5,"I am very happy to choose this Premier Inn. I think the best power if this hotel is a staff. I am very impress of their extra help and advices. Reception is really helpful. I would like to thank a lot to Gaile and Guy, who help me with my broken luggage. Breakfast is really nice to eat. I meet there Jan and Francesco who give better services then they need. So I can advice this place everybody who must to be in London especially Excel Inn London.","en"
"1679",5,"Room was attractive and well kept. We enjoyed the British style bathroom very much (it's a bit different than what you will find in the US). And the staff was wonderful. They were friendly, very responsive, and helpful in all ways. Also, we enjoyed the location of the hotel, since it is located in a somewhat historic area of London which has easy access to the tube and to buses.","en"
"1680",4,"The rooms are modern, clean and comfortable. The decor may not be to everyones taste. The corridors are very dimly lit but thats not a criticism in itself.Its a very busy hotel with very few staff on the front desk. My experience with the front desk staff was less than satisfactory. I feel its unacceptable to have to wait in a queue for over 15 minutes just to check if my taxi had arrived.The staff were lovely but were over worked.I have given it 3 stars for the lack of customer service.","en"
"1681",4,"We spent two nights at the Grange St Pauls and were very happy. Perfect location out of the busier areas of Covent Garden and Leicester Square, but still close enough.

A a regular visitor to London, I have stayed in many hotels and I will stay here in future.","en"
"1683",3,"First stay here - as mentioned rooms are small but spotless and functional with a very comfy bed. Staff were very helpful and friendly.

"1684",5,"My partner booked this hotel as a surprise for my birthday. We drove to the hotel (as we live only 30 miles away). There is no parking at the hotel but there is a car park a few streets away. We parked overnight and the hotel arranged a set price of £20 which is good for London. The only drawback (especially for someone with mobility problems) is that it takes about 10-15 minutes to walk back to the hotel. Hotel itself was fine. Very helpful staff and easy check in. The hotel was light, bright and well-decorated. My partner had booked a standard room but we were give up an upgrade to a superior room when we checked in - a nice surprise! The room itself (519) was small but very well furnished with plasma TV, a comfy bed ,complimentary bathrobes and slippers and a fruit basket besides the usual trouser press, minibar etc. I was initially a bit concerned as we were next to what seemed a very lively bar but there was obviously good sound insulation as once inside the room, there was no noise at all. Breakfast was included in the deal and it was very good with a selection of continental or English breakfast items available as well as some that could be cooked to order. The hotel is very centrally located next to London Bridge station and therefore ideal for a visit to Central London. We took advantage of its closeness to Borough Market which is a couple of hundred yards away and went to a great restaurant there (Roast) on the evening and visited the Borough Market (don't miss it!) the following morning. The area is very lively with many restaurants and bars with a great buzzy atmosphere. In short we had a great stay and would thoroughly recommend the hotel and its location.","en"
"1685",5,"Our stay at the hotel was wonderful. The staffs were all friendly and it was pleasant too. It made us feel like our second home. The room was comfortable and cozy. When we arrived, it was on a Friday, so we had the chance to try their buffet. The food, splendid. I am very fond of meat, while my wife is a vegan and overall, they had a equal share of both, so anyone who is vegan is able to enjoy the experience as much as a non-vegan. Their selections of ala carte menu are wonderful as you can eat a variety. I would have eaten everything on the menu if I could as they all looked and sounded fascinating! It was such a marvellous stay for us and our daughter too enjoyed it. Very family friendly as well as child friendly. They really treat you warmly just like their Manja moto. We will definitely come back again for our next visit to London. Plus, if you like a vintage looking place with a modern twist, then this the hotel for you. The decoration is splendid and very stunning.","en"

"1687",5,"I recently stayed in this hotel at the beggining of March 2016. We arrived without a booking and paid a small amount (just over £100) for a double room including spa access, not including breakfast. The room was great, very comfortable and clean. The bath, whilst was a bit small had a lovely sloping back support. The room was equipped with a kettle and complimentry coffees/teas and bottles of water. The location of this hotel is a little walk to the nearest tube station, across the bridge. The spa in this location was average, contained a sauna and steam room (both perfect temperatures) and a swimming pool also a good temperature. Overall the stay at this hotel was perfect, we had a great time.","en"

Situated in a side street and in a beautiful,quiet area of Kensington. Mini bar was an added bonus. Bed was really comfortable and room kept spotlessly clean. We have stayed in London numerous times before but found Hotel Indigo one of the very bet so far. Would not hesitate to recommend it and would certainly book up to stay there again.","en"
"1689",3,"Hotel location is quite good at the far end of Covent Garden, minutes away from Holborn Tube station. Modern looking reception. Check-in was fast and efficient. Corridors are very narrow and slamming doors a nuisance. Rooms are a nice size for London, classical in style. Breakfast buffet is dissapointing. Small choice, especially when it comes to fresh fruit and bread. An average hotel, nothing exciting, nothing bad.","en"

They've shown incredible respect for the many exquisite original details and added original features that turn your stay into a real experience. The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful throughout. At first I was a little concerned about being away from the centre of town but this is an excellent spot to discover East London which is as interesting and vibrant as the hotel itself.","en"
"1693",5,"Stayed here for 5 nights in June 2016 and really enjoyed the hotel.The rooms are modern,clean and have tea/coffee and a well stocked mini bar.

I would reccomend you ask for a room at the back as there are major construction works taking place at the front of the hotel.","en"

Possibility to leave the baggage before and after check out. Continental breakfast at buffet with eggs, becon, tomatoes, beans, bread cerials, jam, fruts and nutella ;) The room was all renew and very modern and comfortable! Two bottles of water and kettle with tea included and a free drink at the bar. We sleep so good here!

"1696",1,"So, I stayed here as part of the 'Be My Guest' promotion for a stay with room maintenance issues at another Doubletree worldwide. Other than the absolutely ridiculous and very stressful hassle trying to book a hotel in London on the date we wanted and having to call up numerous lines, I was glad I could use my voucher at the marble arch hotel in London. (my fourth choice) It is in a good location and easily accessible. On checking in, we were greeted with the obligatory cookies (however in comparison to other doubletree's, the cookies here were rock hard- but at midnight i suppose I shouldnt expect any fresher...) We went up to our room. Surprised by the size but it is London so kind of expecting a tiny box so could deal with that... However, for a room that is valued at over £250 it has NO double glazing on the windows. Even on the fourth floor you can hear the traffic... Its in a city for goodness sake. All night- sirens, bikes etc heard through the sash windows. My family lives in central London and WITH double glazing you cant hear these. I was disappointed and quite disgusted that a hotel this size wouldnt have that as a priority during its design concept (even as a second fix to maintain the look from the exterior). Luckily I had bought ear plugs. The bathroom door is see-through with a film on it, so even with the blind down in the bathroom you will still get the light through when the sun rises. I hope you like a never ending extractor fan too because that stays on all night! Dont bother trying to have a cup of tea because it's in a drawer and you have to take every item out individually... I was thankful that an iron was in the room and the little bathroom goodies are helpful. (one of mine was half used though meaning it hadnt been replaced from a previous guest- which is also really disappointing and quite yukky...) So, other than the room being somewhat of a let down, it was a comfortable (small) bed in central London. However, what had been a mediocre stay turned out to leave a very sour taste. After check out, we received a voicemail advising that we hadnt given them our voucher (which we had handed to a colleague at midnight not some 11 hours previous) and that we would need to return (we were on our way home) to provide it. I returned the call advising that it had been handed to a member of staff on the night desk (there were 2 of them there!). I was then questioned as to whether or not I had done it. I was made to feel like a child. For a hotel to do this (did they not even look in their paperwork) I was appalled. The vouchers have unique codes on them so it is not like i can use it anywhere else anyway! They didnt call back so I will assume they found it. An apology would have been nice. This hotel has left an even bigger dent in my image of the doubletree brand. I just wish hilton would look at the guest experience more. Little things like: >Making sure that things are easy to use (the tea on the desk rather than in a drawer!) >The windows being double glazed. >The toiletries being replenished None of these are hard and should all be part of design and the quality control that should happen in the rooms on a daily basis. A hotel is an escape from the day to day and it should feel like that. This room was worse than a Travelodge/ motel room (with a smaller bed might I add!!) I am doubtful that we will stay in a hilton or doubletree again unless something really does change my mind. I have had better service/ \ a better experience from budget hotels. Thanks for a stay that I will be forgetting.","en"
"1697",4,"Stayed here for 1 night for a leisure trip. Arrived early Saturday morning, and pleasantly surprised that our room was ready. Efficient check in process with a friendly service. Good sized room, with nice big bed and large walk in shower. The location is fantastic, 10 min walk to theatre land, covent garden etc, and 5mins from Tottenham court road. Great choice for breakfast again with a friendly service. Would stay here again if in london.","en"
"1698",1,"This place is a mixed bag. Sometimes it can be a great stay but other times really made me want to leave mid stay. The hotel is three min blocks east wing west wing and the tower. I would aim for the west wing as its refurbished. Being in the west wing is like a time warp! The front desk staff are probably the best I have endured at a hilton hotel. However the support staff are poor at best. For example I ordered some tea bags for my room with room service and it took them 40 minutes to deliver. To me that's very disappointing. On a different stay I enquired about the top floor restaurant but the host there was very rude and refused to allow any flex around when I might be able to get a table or advise when best to book it. The location is nice if all you want to eat is Arabic food. Although there is a marks and Spencer's cross the road. Edgware road tube is across the road closer than paddington but even that is less than 5 minutes walk. There is a tesco, superdrug and KFC all nearby.","en"
"1699",4,"Me and my husband have recently just returned from our stay at the president hotel. This was booked as a superbreak deal for 2 nights, including an evening meal on our first night. I honestly couldn't fault anything about the hotel, it was very clean, warm and comfortable. The evening meal on our 1st night was a 3 course meal with breakfast for the 2days was a full English breakfast, toast, porridge and cereals available. We have just booked another superbreak trip for may and taking the kids this time and the only reason we are not stopping in this hotel is that they don't have family rooms available, or would would of definitely book for this hotel again.","en"
"1700",2,"Massive disappointment, first they overbooked and tried to put us in a twin room, then when we said no, they wanted to put us in a smoking room (we are non-smokers). After arguing with the less than helpful reception staff he spoke to his manager and after a huge wait we were put in a tired old room, Air con was not working properly, wallpaper peeling, window was left open and only a maintenance man could close it. The bed was not particularly comfortable with springs in the mattress making noises every time you turned over. The noise in our room was relatively loud from the trains outside as well, even after they closed the window. The best thing is we found a Tesco express a few hundred metres away and we found a theatre cafe called the Space which had big meals and a friendly staff about 25 mins walk away, but though fairly industrial looking landscape. When you pay $200+ for a room you expect some reasonable quality and this wasn't it.","en"

"1705",4,"We redeemed Hilton points for a 2 night stay and had requested a twin room away from Holland Park Ave. We arrived a bit earlier than check in time after an overnight flight from the US and had we been willing to take a room on a low floor on Holland Park Ave, we could have had a room immediately. As it was, we chose to wait about an hour for a room on the back of the hotel. The room was tiny, though we've stayed in smaller ones in London! And it was very clean, comfortable and fairly quiet, though some city noise is inevitable. The executive lounge on the ground floor served rather nice snacks and wine in the evening. We were so tired our first evening that we made that our dinner. Breakfasts were also quite nice, with a variety of foods. The staff in the lounge and at the front desk were all very friendly and helpful. Big thanks to them for their courtesy. But the concierge staff were very odd. They were quite pushy about getting us a taxi to a restaurant that we weren't interested in going to. And when we did want a taxi to Paddington for the Heathrow Express (luggage in tow), they tried to pressure us into a taxi to Heathrow - ""I can get you a deal"" he said. We turned that down too! Ironically, the taxi we did get for Paddington ended up taking us all the way to Heathrow, but for 1/2 of the price the price the concierge was quoting. Book your own taxis! The Holland Park area itself is lovely, the park is a great place to walk, enjoy the woods & flowers and even catch a bit of local cricket. Though the hotel isn't in the heart of the tourist areas, the Shepherds Bush & Holland Park tube stops are both convenient. And if you're lucky, you'll meet the Holland Park station attendant who serenades passengers!","en"
"1706",3,"This is a perfect location for a weekend away in the city with friends. The bar stays open until late (3.30am) and the staff are helpful and friendly. This hotel is a stones throw from the tube as well as shops and restaurants - Overall a good experience!","en"

Only 1 gripe - one of the Exec standard rooms (we had 3) had small wardrobe, unsuitable to hang more that a couple of short items. Otherwise, other 2 rooms would have rated overall Excellent rating However, will return any other time we can get a bit of a deal on price!","en"
"1708",3,"Stayed at the hotel Saturday night very busy. If you want a quite room get a high one. Great views of London. Breakfast service and food good. Me and my wife went to the pub attached to the hotel for a meal on the night after a long day in London seeing the sites, when I ordered the food at the bar the 10% discretionary charge at the bottom of the menu was automatically added to the bill. When I questioned it the bar staff said it was for bringing the food to the table. Thought that was what they got paid for? Anyway I was to tired to argue so except it's compulsory and add 10% to the price.  ","en"

I'm sure it would be ok if you're only staying a couple of nights but we were on an extended stay.","en"
"1710",2,"I am a gold card member as well but I just went ahead and booked an executive room without waiting for an upgrade. Not really worth the extra money in my opinion. First problem was on checking in when for some reason they had my home address wrong and had no idea of my priority number. Eventually got that sorted out by telephone to some guy in the states (I presume) who was very efficient and soon sorted it out. Next problem was the room. No dressing gowns or slippers and the safe did not work. The desk light had no shade and could not be used because of the brightness. It was all sorted out by a couple of very pleasant staff but surely the room should have been checked beforehand? There is not really much, if any, in the way of function rooms and on the night we arrived a party had taken up most of the restaurant/bar area along with some pretty loud music. Quite enjoyed it later (especially my niece!) but to be told you may not be able to have dinner in the restaurant because of said party was a bit off I thought. Again, it turned out ok but only after I rearranged some of the furniture so we could sit down. Bar staff were very efficient. Breakfast compared to other H.I. was poor. Quite a small serving area and no fried eggs. You could of course order them but after 20 minutes we tired of waiting. Sausages were very good however, try them, you won't be disappointed. Check out was fine if a little slow. Never used the mini bar but it is one of those that activate if you even look at it and we got charged for 2 items we had not taken. Receptionist was not phased and soon sorted it out. Car parking is safe and plenty of it and the area is pretty safe. Footbridge across to the shopping centre which has a pizza hut amongst other eateries. Did not see any pubs close by but hey, its only a few minutes from the big city!","en"
"1711",4,"There is little point me reviewing the hotel itself as all premier inn's are much of a muchness. Our room was a little smaller than I had previously experienced but I guess that's London for you. That said, the room was comfortable & very quiet. We had a good night's sleep (thanks for the intro Lenny) and a lovely breakfast in the morning although that was an extra £8.50 per head. We only paid £49 for the room which, for London, was excellent and the hotel is well situated about 10 minutes walk from Hammersmith tube station. However, what did set this hotal apart was the staff. Everyone we interacted with were excellent & a credit to the Premier Inn brand.","en"
"1712",4,"The hotel was greatly situated across the Victoria Station. It is about 15 minutes walk to Buckingham Palace. Within walking distance, there are different options to eat: restaurants, coffee shops, fast food and pubs. The room was clean, cozy and comfortable. The staff was friendly and helpful. The Wi-Fi is paid. We tried the big breakfast buffet, which had an assortment from yoghurt, fruits, cold cuts, cheese, pastries, bread, juices, milk, cereals, vegetables, sausages, bacon and fish. At no additional cost, we ordered items from a la carte menu. We were disappointed that they did not serve scones for breakfast. When we asked for scones, we were told that there will be an extra charge by the piece, since they only offer them for tea time. It is a shame that for a big breakfast, they would not include scones, since it is so British. I was quite surprised that they would not offer a piece of scone complimentary for a foreigner that wanted to enjoy British food, while we could order anything a la carte included in the breakfast. It makes no sense. I can't imagine that it would cost more than the pastry and baked goods assortment that they had in the buffet.","en"

I've been staying with them for a few years now since they bought the hotel and refurbished it throughout with top range bathroom furniture. Location is perfect and very central. All rooms are air conditioned, very welcome in London in the Summer. Rooms at the rear of the hotel are quieter as Southampton Row can get busy very early and the entrance to the lift is also by the front facing rooms. I've never had any problems with Wi-fi connection, which is invaluable these days.","en"
"1714",4,"Just returned back from a trip to London where I stayed 9 nights at the Crowne Plaza Kensington on Cromwell road. We stayed in a family duplex suite (#125) which was great. Kids had a sofa bed in the lower floor with their own bathroom while we had a queen size bed and our own bathroom on the top floor. First night was not good since they assigned us a smaller dupkex suite (#103) with no bathroom on the lower floor even though they know we were 2 adults and 2 kids. Mr. Will from the reception desk was very helpful in making sure we were moved to the next available larger suite the next day. Being in a duplex suite gives you access to the club lounge where breakfast is served (continental and English breakfast.) They also serve alcohol daily from 6-8 p.m with some hors d' oeuvres. The hotel is two minutes walk from a bus station and from the Gloucester Street subway station...there are many restaurants around, Tesco Express, Waitrose as well as Sainsbury's are all within a walking distance. .

Prepare yourself for a no-frills experience, fifth floor room with no lift, creaky stairs, small and old-fashioned bathrooms, mediocre beds etc. In spite of this I would probably book this hotel again: The management seemed to be working on improving the property (was awakened at 7 am by carpenters working in the next door room) and the front-desk attendants turned out to be very helpful. The hotel is fairly centrally located, on a quiet street within 10 min walking from the Department of Transport and other ministries in Westminster.

It was surprisingly quiet, maybe we were lucky that there was no one noisy on our corridor. It is very handy for Westfields shops and restaurants, for dinner and breakfast, lots of choice. Did not use the Premier Inn restaurant for this reason. However, if you dont like lifts, this is the only option here, apart from 149 steps from front door to reception. We used the 149 stairs down on checking out because the lifts were busy, was disgusted to see rubbish, and condoms on the stair well near the bottom. Therefor have not given this 5 stars. Public have free access to these stairs during the night, very bad design.","en"

"1721",3,"Stayed in May 2013 for a birthday weekend with my other half. Location is good for a walk to Westminster, but right next to construction site on John Islip Street. This is obviously outwith hotels control but had I been made aware of it I wouldnt have made my booking. Staff couldn't have been nicer, from allowing us to check in early and get changed into cooler clothes, from quickly providing more water and bathrobes on request (although the bathrobes should have been in the room already) Rooms were clean and tidy, if a little basic for the rate. No bath in bathroom, no view, no flair at all bar the Mac system which didnt always work. I also found our room far too hot. The air con on full blast still didnt allow me to sleep comfortably. The shower in the room also switched from a normal temperature to scalding hot with no warning, so be aware when visiting. Overall for £300 for a weekend without breakfast I would have been better using my money elsewhere as this really struck me as a Travelodge with a Mac in the room. Not on par with other Hilton Doubletrees. Fine for business, not so much for a romantic weekend.","en"
"1722",5,"This is an upscale hotel in the heart of west side and near most attractions. It is a short walk from the waterfront, great restaurants, great museums and great shopping. The front desk and Concierge staff were superb They were there to go the extra step or two to make the experience more memorable. One night we asked for a taxi to go to a nearby pub. The only reason we did not walk is because it was raining. One of the concierge staff overheard us and offered to give us a ride in the hotel Aston Martin. WOW! What a ride! It was too short though. Gary, thank you again. You are the best. The room was spacious and very comfortable. Housekeeping was reliable and came at our suggested time slot everyday. Breakfast is offered in two separate locations. We enjoyed having breakfast at the Holborn dining room. The staff were so cheerful. We simply cannot say enough good things about this hotel that has been under this new ""Rosewood "" management for only two years. We have been to many hotels in London.

The rooms were very clean and the bed was comfortable enough. My only complaint about the room was the view. When you opened the blinds there was a walkway from one building to the other and people could see right in so we had to keep the blinds shut. The staff at the front desk were very knowledgeable about the area and gave us a great recommendation on the best Indian restaurants in the city. I would definitely stay at this hotel again!","en"
"1724",2,"We were put on the 10th floor and the heat was unbearable to sleep. I was travelling with my two small children and elderly mother and we had very little sleep the first night. We were moved the second night to the 5th floor which was slighly better. Staff were pleasant and helpful, but very little they could do about the heat apart from offer ice and an extra fan, which made no difference.","en"
"1725",4,"For the price it's a good place to stay although its not in the centre of London. Room was large and the bed very comfortable and the bathroom was large too - nice powerful shower. Overall looked nice, clean and modern. The Tube stop was only a few minutes away through an underpass and it's then straight into London.","en"
"1726",5,"We use the Citadines St Marks for business stays most weeks. It's excellent. The location is good - a short walk from Angel underground station and all the restaurants of Upper Street, and also within easy reach of the Barbican on foot. The rooms are quiet, very clean and well appointed, with well-equipped kitchenettes and comfortable sitting areas: we've tried studios, one-bedroom and two-bedroom apartments and have been happy with all of them. The staff are very helpful, especially Gautam and Fabienne, who are always very attentive and professional.","en"
"1727",2,"Difficult review this one as we booked this hotel up hurriedly on the way to London staying that night via late rooms then read the reviews. Oh dear we thought and started to panic rang late rooms back up to say hopefully we could cancel due to the negative reviews they have had. Lateroom's got straight onto the case but called back five minutes later to ask that the manager was not in until tomorrow so we MAY end up paying even if we didn't stay. So I blamed the poor old husband and he took the ear bashing. We went and had a great day out then decided to check in to see what we had let ourselves in for. Firstly we arrived to see a notice on the front door to check in at Tophams Hotel no 28 instead of No 50 which annoyed me as we had walked back and lets face was this place was never going to stand a chance especially as when we walked into Tophams what a lovely bright, clean and shiny reception, so we negatively checked in for Belgravia Mews then to be told that Tophams was not fully booked so they had upgraded us to for the same price, I honestly saw my husband's shoulders lift about a foot with relief so went happily to our room No 4 which was in the basement opened the door and got a really pleasant surprise considering what we thought we would be getting!! then on closer inspection...... there was a really bad odour of damp/drains in the room, the shower lights were not working, a HUGH bath but the shower attachment would only work with the bath taps on, sealing and grouting missing in the bathroom, chips on the woodwork and the carpet could have done with a good clean, the mattress was so soft you sunk in the middle and then the air conditioning seemed to have a mind of its own. However remember we got this at a bargain price of £62.16 including breakfast so should we be complaining probably not! The next morning we remember the clonking noise as people walked through the reception area above but we had things to do so didn’t want a lay in (good job really). We also then noticed no milk or English tea in the hospitality tray so ventured to breakfast. English breakfast luckily for us was included in the price although again I think this was because we had been upgraded as I heard someone enquire if they could have a cooked breakfast. The waitress obviously says yes but it was £19.95, thank goodness she declined. The breakfast was buffet style and when I got there they had run out of eggs and bacon, the rest was all being kept warm under not very efficient chaffing tins. The Danish pastries were excellent though so probably best to stick to continental breakfast. Summary: We did well in the end for £62.16 in the middle of London and were grateful for the upgrade despite the maintenance issues. The reason why I am publishing this on both hotels is to warn others not to pay TOO much for the Topham’s hotel as it does have its downfalls and perhaps try and get an upgrade if you are staying at Belgravia Mews which we could not fault as we did not stay there. All staff were polite but when we pointed out the smell issue not much notice was taken so overall ok but wouldn’t pay over the top for this hotel.","en"
"1728",5,"Situated at seven dials, this hotel is so well placed to enjoy so much of London ...... didn't need to use the tube at all. Modern, sophisticated, but also relaxed, impeccably clean. Rooms small, but very well laid out, very comfy bed and pillows .... everything to high standard ..... only grumble would be that there was no hair dryer in room. Breakfast at Scoff and Banter was a treat. Quality, not cheap ..... but not extortionate, and considering the location amazingly good value","en"
"1729",5,"My wife was given a voucher for ""afternoon tea"" here. The tea was very good, with just the right amount of finger sandwiches, scones [cream & a choice of several jams, not just the usual] & cakes. in fact there was a little too much for us to manage so we had 3/4 of the mini cakes boxed to have at home that evening ! For anyone staying in this part of London The Grosvenor House is well worth considering for afternoon tea [it is normally a little expensive but then again so is London !!] The service was very good & the staff friendly. All in all a very positive experience & a great gift to give anyone who enjoys a cream tea !","en"
"1730",4,"Stayed here march 14th for one night as a stop off prior to going abroad. Really close to Euston train station so good location! When arriving greeted by welcoming staff who directed my girlfriend and I to our rooms. Rooms were just as expected, spacious and clean with a comfy bed and a decent shower. Decided to have dinner in the hotel as we were offered a meal deal, now the bad part. Booked the meal for 8 o clock 6 hours earlier, when arriving at the restaurant we were told by an arrogant waiter that there would be a wait and to enjoy the bar.. (Bar staff were excellent but to be told to enjoy the bar on our own money was not that excellent as we wanted a drink after our meal). 25 minutes later our table was ready. As soon as Mr happy realised we had a meal deal voucher he snatched it out of my hand and huffed and puffed. Food was average and there was a huge wait for the main course (I'm talking 30 minutes plus after starters). Every time the waiter passed he would give my girlfriend and I a dirty look and huff. When desserts arrived the waitress who served them apologised for the long waits which was appreciated. Whom I suspect to be the manager came over and explained that our last round of drinks would be on the house which once again I was extremely thankful. Upon leaving I left a tip but still received a huff and a puff from Mr happy! Really not sure why but oh well. All in all the hotel was just what we needed - comfy bed for the night. So I feel that if it wasn't for this one arrogant waiter it would have received 5 stars!! Would stay here again but not eat in the restaurant. P.s the lifts are a bit tricky.","en"
"1731",4,"Stayed here for one night whilst working down in London. It is okay, just a little bit old fashioned. I got a very friendly reception from the staff and the check in was quick and painless. The room was a decent enough size, bathroom a little cramped but not too bad for one night. The TV reception/picture quality was poor and you have to pay for wifi (always annoys me in hotels!) No iron and ironing board in the room other than a little half size one, you have to phone for a proper one. Thee was only whole milk with the tea and coffee which was some own branded stuff. Having said all that It is a good location, 2 mins from Holborn tube, 10 min walk from The Strand/Covent Garden. Would I want to stay her more than a couple of nights? Probably not, I'd go for something a bit more modern.","en"
"1732",4,"Stopped here for 2 nights mid week, front desk was excellent, very well located. Although the room we had was the smallest in the hotel it was very appointed and served our needs. Spotless room and very contemporary decor. Only 5 mins from Olympia station and plenty shops and places eat. Will stay here again when in London.","en"
"1733",4,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel on a brief overnight stop off in London. The hotel is very well located and easily accessible by both road and public transport. I was very impressed by the courteous, efficient staff and in particular would single out the very helpful restaurant manager (I don't recall his name but I believe he was Indian) and Lorenzo and Sergio behind reception as being particularly courteous. After a recent poor experience with another Hilton property it was great to have a stay that reminded me why I stay loyal to the brand and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the hotel to others. The only thing that let it down was ""fake"" Nespresso capsules in the room!","en"
"1734",1,"Believe every bad review and then some about this hotel. We were greeted by the receptionist with all the charm of a snarling snapping feral dog. The duty manager was called as she couldn't do her job checking us in. Hotel room, carpet was so old and dirty needed ripping up (this is in a deluxe room), light above the bed didn't work, when you flushed the toilet it ran forever to fill up. No water pressure, so if you washed your hair you were never going to get the shampoo out. This is a 200 year old hotel and what a general air of being a dump about it. We booked for three nights and the only saving grace was that we were able to check out after one night without having to pay extra. Never before have I ever posted a bad review about a hotel in London but this hotel is awful!!!!!!","en"
"1735",3,"I stayed in May in the Nevern and was delighted with my room. The girl at reception was very helpful and extremely pleasant. However I recently booked to stay overnight for business on a thursday evening. My meeting was cancelled on the monday morning and I immiately tried calling to cancel as they had a policy of 72hrs or they MAY charge. I couldn't get a reply in the morning but spoke to the receptionist in the afternoon explaining the situation. She said that she would have the manager call to see what could be done as it was within the 72hrs alloted. I received no call and was charged non the less. I have called to speak to the manger since and he has never returned my call. I had at this stage recommended the Nevern to other business people who have since stayed there - I have contacted them all to tell them of my experience and each has like me decided that although its a nice place to stay - sharp practice should not be encouraged - I will not be back! Pity as I am in London weekly at the moment!","en"
"1736",5,"Clean, great location, warm and we had a nice big room with a clean bathroom. We couldn't complain out the room.The only thing we didn't like was that the breakfast room had about 4 two people tables and then a table for twelve in the middle. This meant that you had to sit next to strangers to have your breakfast. For some this is fine but it's just not what we like.","en"

"1739",1,"Tune Hotel Kings Cross was a pleasant surprise and my friend and I stayed for 14 nights from Oct 1-15, 2012. It was modern, very clean, comfortable and convenient with easy access to all major tourist attractions and transportation. Our twin-bedded en-suite room in the basement floor was quiet and the lift was tiny! Daily cleaning of the room can be requested at additional cost. Complimentary basic toiletries and towels were only provided upon our check-in. Staff were friendly and helpful. The family-run Cappadocia Cafe & Bistro across the road offers excellent all day breakfasts at great prices. The St.Pancras International and Kings Cross Station nearby offer many food outlets. Would stay there again in future and recommend it to friends too!","en"
"1740",2,"Very basic, but ok for the price you pay in London. All considered, getting a room and a breakfast for the rates of this hotel is rare in London. The staff is friendly and you can get a hot sandwich for breakfast. The underground is very close.","en"
"1741",5,"The Hotel is in a perfect location to visit the sites of London. The room was small but very clean and well equipped. We visited London for our Silver Wedding Anniversary and on the morning of our anniversary my wife and I opened our cards from friends and family, she left the anniversary cards on the bedside table, the empty envelopes she put in the bin under the dresser. The next morning as we was packing to leave we noticed the cards was missing, we complained at reception but although the staff was polite they had no sympathy or understanding of our loss, my wife was very upset. We decided to write to complain rather than stand at reception being pushed to one side. On returning home I sent an e.mail to the hotel with our concerns regarding personal property being taken from our room. The hotel gave our complaint to security to investigate, after a couple of days the conclusion was "" All staff have denied taking any cards from our room (551) and without any other proof they could do nothing"". At the end of the day there was no monetary value to our loss, it was more a sentimental loss. We did not expect any compensation but a proper apology and explanation would of been nice. Me personally, because my wife was so upset, I think if the hotel had sent her the smallest bunch of flowers with a note saying ""Sorry"" we would be writing a very positive review now. But that's not so, basically we have been called lyres and forgotten about.","en"
"1742",4,"Stayed 3 nights and it was ok and I'd say valve for money in bayswater 100m off Hyde park. Good shower, good room with clean bedding and towels it was cleaned daily etc . Continental breakfast was fine plenty of coffee and the staff were helpful too.","en"
"1743",1,"My friend checked in here for her last night in the UK before a flight back to the States and was given the smallest room in the entire south of England. No problem, we had some serious sightseeing to get done so left. The sightseeing turned into a night out and the night out turned into a late night out, so I didn't feel like heading back to Birmingham. On enquiry as to whether we could upgrade the room the guy at front desk first offered us the joint use of it for 10 - 20 minutes, effectively labelling my friend a hooker. Cheers dude. He then very kindly allowed us to buy an entirely new room, saying that he would not be able to resell the original at that hour. As we hadn't used the original at all and he would be equally unable to sell the new room I thought that this was a bit mean. Anyway all that aside, the room was rubbish, the bed sucked, I woke up wth a terrible hangover and the weather was all grey and miserable. This may not be the most objective review ever written.","en"
"1744",5,"We have stayed here twice now and on both occasions we have agreed that it has been our best hotel experience in the World. From the moment you walk through yhe doors everything is designed to make you feel relaxed and at home. The rooms are well designed, beautifully decorated and spotlessly clean, the facilities are fantastic, but like all really great hotels it is the staff who set One Aldwych apart. Everyone from reception to concierge to bar staff to room service and even the housekeeping staff who we spoke to were friendly and polite and obviously took a genuine interest in how much we were enjoying our stay. Can't wait to come back.","en"
"1745",4,"My colleague and I booked 2 single rooms for 2 nights. No problem in reaching the hotel from Earl's Court station, exit the station, turn left, and the first street you cross to your left is Trebovir Rd. It's exactly 2 min. The room was small, but it was indeed very clean. The bed was very comfortable, quite spacious, and only had a soft duvet, which I through was very hygienic, since I hate the awful bed covers all hotels have. The bathroom was slightly bigger than an airplane's, but I already knew from the traveler's photos on Tripadvisor. However, the water pressure in the shower was great, so was the temperature, totally adjustable. The wifi was ok. When I booked I called to ask if we could be given a room facing the outer street, since from the photos I saw some rooms faced brick walls, and considering how small the single rooms are I wanted to at least have a view on the street, which is very quiet. The day we left we left our luggage at the reception, and come back for them in the afternoon. Since we needed to change before our flight, we did so in the public restrooms downstairs which were also very clean. My overall experience is excellent, it's a very clean hotel not just for London's standards and its location is perfect, central but in a quiet road. Will visit again next time I'm in London!","en"
"1746",5,"Stayed here for a couple of nights....hotels in London are expensive and this came in on the cheaper side! But it did the job just fine - the room wasn't that huge, there isn't a proper wardrobe, it can be a bit tricky where to put luggage etc. On the plus sides, there was no noise from other rooms, the room was clean and modernly decorated, bathroom was nice, great shower. Best thing about the hotel is it's location really, handy to get to the tube station and into the central area of London. Finchley Road is also a nice place, good vibe around. Staff were polite and friendly and got me two extra pillows (for some weird reason there was only one pillow on each bed and no extra ones in the room, similarly there could have been some more towels in the bathroom). Breakfast in the mornings is good too. Overall, good for value and had a good stay there.","en"
"1747",5,"Given the price I wasn't really expecting a lot from this place, but I needed somewhere close to the O2. This place was perfect. A few minutes walk from Canning town DLR / Tube station, and a doddle to get back to after the concert finished. The room was clean and comfortable (and air conditioned, which we were glad of on the hottest day of the year!). Staff were pleasant, and the breakfast buffet had a good selection (which included sausage / egg / beans, so that was me sorted). I really cannot grumble. Would certainly stay here again.","en"
"1748",4,"Booked this place based on price during Olympic week 1. Was very pleased with the value for money for our family room, and found the room bigger than expected with modern decor, a lovely bathroom, and great to have the air con in what was a warm week.

"1749",5,"Just had a great night at this hotel. Really quiet, very comfortable and clean and just two stops from Kings Cross.

"1750",4,"The hotel is ideally located 2 min away from Gloucester station, and it doesn't take very long to get to most attractions in London (10-20 minutes tops) - Big Ben, Westminster Abbey, London Eye, shopping, restaurants. You can also take the tube directly from the airport to the hotel, no connections or line changes. It was super practical, considering the ride will cost you about 6-8£/pers (I don't quite remember...). When I went to London, I wasn't able to take the tube back to the airport and it cost me about 55£ by taxi... Other than that, the rooms were very clean, the concierge was super helpful (we booked a couple of attractions with him) and you CAN get free wifi if you sign up for IHG points (it's free).","en"

No bar, but there's a small vending machine in reception. 2 lifts. Left luggage room. Plentiful breakfast with lots of variety - very busy so a small wait for various items but nobody left hungry.

The room was exceedingly spacious with a separate lounge, bedroom, 2 separate toilets, waterfall shower, separate bath and twin sinks. The hotel is very clean and welcoming. We were able sit outside on the balcony overlooking the marina to have our breakfast. Only one negative... When I ordered 2 glasses of sparkling Rose for my husband and I, I did not expect to be charged £34!!!! We later checked the drinks menu and realised that the only sparkling rose that the hotel offers is the rose champagne. Probably my fault for not checking the menu but it would have been nice for the waiter to mention this when I ordered so that I could have ordered another wine. However, like I said, beautiful hotel and lovely staff but still feel a little cheated with the drinks as I have never paid £34 for 2 small alcoholic drinks before but I will be wiser next time!!!!!","en"

"1762",5,"Unfortunately our stay at Collingham in apt 132 was disappointing. The condition of the apartment was poor and not of the description advertised. A £350 deposit is required incase of any breakage. You would have to wreck the entire apartment to come close to that figure. There is no security lock on the front door and no privacy lock on the bathroom door, just a hole where it should be. No toiletries like mini shampoos, tissues etc. Zero in the way of any personal touches. The floor boards in the whole apartment creek so loud it is impossible not to disturb anyone in the apartment or below. The advertised full size fridge freezer was a small under the counter fridge. There is no air conditioning or balcony. The view is of a brick building. As we pulled the sofa bed into shape we were disgusted to find a large stain on the mattress with spots which appeared to be dried blood. I took a photo and descended three flights of narrow stairs to report the problem as you cannot find the phone number of the front desk anywhere. The single elevator was archaic. Reception said housekeeping had gone home and gave me a sheet to cover the stain. Sleeping on a sheet knowing another persons bodily fluid stains were underneath was not something that comforted me. The welcome amenities were missing so I was given a bottle of screw cap 'Tesco Table Wine' which I duly returned. Foyer is sterile with no flowers or welcome signage.This is not a 4 star luxury facility as advertised.","en"
"1763",5,"after staying at this hotel again recently i found it necessary to leave a review to show my appreciation of this hotel, without doubt the best travel lodge i have stayed in and i do use these places for 2 weeks every month, ideal location for every need whilst staying in london but the the one thing that makes this hotel stand out from any other in my experience, is the first class service from the staff, from the cleaning staff to the management you are always made to feel welcome and if you need any help with anything they are only too glad to help you. on my most recent stay which involved severe toothache on my part the staff on reception namely neney, vimbai rahman and the manager millie helped me out in any way they could knowing i was not well, during the evening a young man called dilwar was always at hand just in case there was anything needed, i will be visiting this hotel again shortly and would not consider anywhere else, i would strongly reccommend this hotel to anyone easy access to attractions, underground restaurants etc especially the red hot chilli on lehman street for a curry","en"

"1766",5,"My girlfriend and I stayed in this hotel for 4 nights in a standard room on the third floor. The room was amazing, large bed, lots of pillows, a couch to sit on, plenty of room to store clothes and so on. Fabulous bathroom with a great shower (rain shower + jets) and a nice bath. Only thing noted for the bathroom is that one button in the shower for using one of the jets was not working correctly). No problems with water leaking or anything. Big shower also (2 persons can fit in which is fun ). The only thing you also need to look out for is the fact that the mini-bar uses an automatic billing system (clearly states is) meaning if you put something you bought into the fridge yourself and you move something it will be charged to your room. Staff was very friendly and professional. Check-in went smooth, 100 pound deposit was required. Our room price included continental breakfast. It was good, fresh croissants, other bakery things and cheeses and cold meats to choose from next to a variety of cereals. Maybe offer a larger selection of fresh fruit and yoghurt in the future? Full english breakfast looked delicious but a bit pricy. We tried out the health club, full lenght swimming pool, whirl pool and something that creates bubbles for your feet. Very nice and clean. Changing area and towels are on location. At the reception you can ask for bath robes and they bring it very quickly up to your room. All in all a very good, clean hotel with a friendly staff. The first thing my girlfriend said when leaving the hotel to go back to Belgium, and I agree, is that when we come back to London and we can get a simular price we will be using the Grange Tower Bridge Hotel again.","en"

"1769",4,"We stayed at this Premier Inn in mid December, 2011, as we were attending a concert at the O2 arena. We wanted to stay at a hotel that was close by to where we were visiting & one that was great value too, so this hotel really fitted that purpose indeed. Getting to the O2 was no problem at all, it takes approx 15-20 minutes via the train ( The DLR is close by ) or via the car, which is even better if you have a Sat Nav, like we did. We decided to take the car, as we had pre-booked our parking online at the O2 prior to arriving in London. Initially, we were not sure if this would be abit of a nightmare decision or not lol, with deciding to take the car instead of the train & with it being London, but we were actually quite pleasantly surprised of the ease of our journey to the O2 & also back to the hotel, so don't be afraid to take the car if you prefer to. Our stay at this hotel was very good from the moment of our arrival. Upon arrival we very kindly asked if we could have a room if possible at the back of the hotel, which is actually more quietier than the ones at the front of the hotel, due to the DLR & London City Airport being so close by. Our request was no problem at all & we did have a great night's sleep. The staff were all very friendly & helpful & the hotel itself & the room we stayed in all seemed very clean indeed. We didn't have an evening meal in the restaurant, but we had pre-booked to have the breakfast the next morning before leaving. This was unfortunately our only little problem that we unfortunately found with our stay.... is that it would have been much better if the hot option choices of the fantastic, eat as much as you like, great value breakfasts that we had, were actually hotter. It may have just been that we were just unfortunately unlucky on that particular morning & it may in general not be very much of a problem at all, but, I am also sure that it is something that could be very easily rectified if it is, to make the breakfasts much more enjoyable, than most visitors probably already find them. But overall, despite that little problem, we would stay here again if visiting the O2 or any other places of interest nearby & would recommend it purely because of the location, the friendly service & the great value.","en"
"1770",5,"We stayed 4 nights at The Rembrandt in the beginning of December. I recommend this hotel because: 1) Location between Tube stations South Kensington and Knightsbridge. Close to Harrods. 2) Transport: You can take Piccadilly Line from Heathrow to one of the stations mentioned above. Piccadilly Line directly to Arsenal (Emirates Stadium), if you are a football fan. :) 3) Rooms: Clean and ok. 4) Breakfast: You get a good start with the solid English Breakfast they serve. Consider this hotel for your next stay.","en"
"1771",5,"I have stayed at this hotel many times and have always had a good room i was worried when i read some of the listings, this stay was a bit special so i booked a exec suit. this was on the seventh floor with great views over London. Now the good bit, the Staff are ALL so freindly. So a little tip, spend the extra for a suit, (good breakfast) I will be back soon!","en"
"1772",4,"I booked this hotel on last minute and asked for a nice room and was offered an upgrade to the top floor in the millennium hotel. It was nothing out of the ordinary, but at the same time, it was a pleasant and an efficient stay. Staff were always there 24/7, and it was only a short walk to the tube stop. The area boasts some nice bars, and with all this in mind, would certainly recommend this hotel at a reasonable price.","en"
"1773",5,"Having been fortunate enough to stay in numerous London hotels for both business and pleasure, the Malmaison has been simply one of the best. Close enough to everything London has to offer yet somehow avoiding the hordes of tourists. The experience starts with a friendly yet efficient welcome from the reception staff. The attitude of the staff throughout the hotel was exemplary - attentive without being intrusive. The decor thoughout and in particular in the bedrooms was stunning. As for the beds - they are surely the most comfortable beds in London. We had dinner in the new restaurant and the food was fantastic. Having recently visited the Gaucho steak resturant opposite Smithfield Market I was amazed to find this place serving better steaks (and better value to boot!). The breakfast was also very nice. On a final note, we happened to meet the hotel manager whilst we were there. His attentive and professional manner appears to permeate throughout the staff in this hotel - quite a refreshing change for a London hotel.","en"
"1774",5,"The Vanderbillt is one of my favourite hotels in London, mainly due to the character of the hotel and it being a block of town houses which have been combined to make the hotel. The staff are always warm and friendly, the rooms comfortable and being a little out from the centre, the area is quiet. The hotel is ideal for visiting the Science museum, V&A, Natural History museum plus the Albert Hall, Hyde Park, Harrods etc. Handy for Gloucester Road tube, the West End is minutes away.","en"
"1775",3,"Another business hotel which is quite modern and smart and right on the bend in the thames overlooking the millenium dome. But it is in a small gated community in the midst of apache land. It is a long walk to Canary Wharf and the area is not exactly charming, more ""edgy"" really. The rooms..ho hum, expensive and really quite solidy average. Could really be bothered to go back.","en"
"1776",4,"This was the first time I had used an Ibis budget hotel and was surprised at how comfortable I found it. The Whitechapel hotel is located on a main road and can be very noisy throughout the night and with extensive roadwork's currently right outside, there was a rather rude awakening on Saturday morning. The room was comfortable and clean, although the decoration perhaps a bit tired. Many people have commented on the hard beds, which I personally do not mind, however I can see where they are coming from. The brand is described as budget, but yet they still change towels everyday and provide soap in the room. You could argue that the lack of other (tea and coffee) amenities is not on a par with other similar 'rivals' but for the price difference I am happy to accept this. The unlimited free Wi-Fi is also a bonus and unheard of elsewhere. Was not told of the need to use room key to gain access to the hotel at night - which is a bit frustrating when you are standing outside - this is a basic which should be communicated at check in. However overall this is a good cheap hotel, convenient for the river, West End, City and Tower Hill areas although perhaps not the place for a single lady late at night when walking back from the nearby tube stations.","en"
"1777",4,"This hotel was so lovely! The professionalism of the hotel was impeccable. From the moment of checking in until checking out the staff made the stay that little bit extra special. I would recommend staying here but it is quite expensive. The hotel has a spa and pool area which was at the same standard as the hotel, lovely warm pool and sauna and steam room.","en"
"1778",5,"We changed from The Montague to The Milestone Hotel because the suite was in the basement. We followed the offer from the Management of The Montague. They showed us an impressive picture and my husband said: ""Oh, that should be one of the best in London."" He read it at ""trip advisor"". So we took it. Yes we had more space and yes we had a window, but we've got an very old ""smelling"" suite. The bathroom was tiny and the stuff - accept two - were not that friendly. But we wanted to enjoy our stay, so we made the best of it. The price for a ""tiny"" steak was incredible and the steak itself was not that great. I think it's very hard to impress us, because we are living in a country with an high restaurant standard. The next time we'll take our first choice in London - The Wellesley. If you have the money for the Montague (the first one we booked), you give a little bit more and you will get the best. High-priced but high level.","en"
"1779",4,"stayed here with my young daughter for one night whilst we watched a west end show. Prime location for London at a low price. The hotel is in need of some repairs, however the room was clean and comfortable. All staff we came across were friendly and helpful. Breakfast was plentiful and delicious, although the waiter was so busy that he struggled to clear tables for the next guests (and napkins would have been beneficial). Enjoyed it though and my daughter ate for free. On the whole I would stay here again. For those who need it, you get 30mins of wifi free.","en"
"1780",5,"Having stayed in Premier Inn's previously we decided to try this one on our weekend visit to London. We were more than happy with our choice - so much so that we are in London again in February & will book into a Premier Inn & we are planning another stay at this particular hotel later in the year. The only downside to our whole stay was that we had problems with the heating, it was a snowy weekend & if we turned the heating above 23 it stopped working. Then it seemed to stop working again on our 2nd day in the room. The reception staff are all very friendly & efficient. We were asked if we would like a quiet room, which we got, which was away from the main street. On our return to the hotel late on Saturday night,we asked for extra milk for our room, the young man on reception gave us the 4 he had in reception & offered to bring more up to our room, which he did about 10 minutes later. We didnt eat in the hotel. Location is excellent for sightseeing &getting around London. Just a short walk from Tower Hill tube station & The Tower Of London. We found a Tesco Express around the corner & a Wetherspoons on the corner and a fabulous Indian restaurant at the other end of the street in Leman Street. Great value stay for a weekend in London Thank you once again Premier Inn","en"
"1781",4,"We've stayed in the Club Quarters at St Paul's a couple of times now, and there's not much to complain about. Sure, the rooms are a little small, but that's about it. There is an automated check in/out. The rooms are clean with good air-con (we stayed during a very hot week, but the room was always cool), they provide USB charging points by the bed, and the location is great - not far from the steps of St Paul's and only a 5 minute walk from the tube station. Lots of local bars and restaurants nearby (Ping Pong Dim Sum is highly recommended). We never buy the hotel breakfast (always too expensive) but there is a really good Garfunkel's two doors down which did an amazing breakfast. Woud definitely stay again.","en"

"1783",5,"My husband and I stayed here from Friday 21st March until Sunday 23rd of March. We arrived approx 2pm and loved the contemporary feel of the hotel as we entered, the staff we very friendly and welcoming. We were told upon check in that we had been given a complimentary upgrade to a superior room which we were very grateful for. Once we arrived to our room we were blown away to find a complimentary bottle of prosecco and some lovely decoration as I had earlier advised reception that we were staying here for our 1st wedding anniversary. We also had a lovely note from Florence which was very sweet, it was such a thoughtful thing to do and showed the hotel goes the extra mile for its guests. We loved the room impeccably clean, probably the cleanest I have stayed in! the decor was lovely and they had a nice book on the desk explaining about the local photography in the hotel rooms which was great. We were also very pleased to see that the hotel offered FREE jelly beans and pringles (usually at an extra cost in all other hotels I have been too) and also the usual hot chocolate, tea, coffee and biscuits etc. We loved everything about it!. The htoel is in a great area nice and quiet but has lots of pubs/resturants/bars to offer and the tube is just a short walk across the road so its a perfect base to explore london and also a nice breather after you've been in with the hustle and bustle all day!After some lovely days spent exploring London we were checking out on the Sunday but didnt have to catch our transport until 4pm so the hotel kindly kept hold of our luggage until we needed to collect it so that we could carry on with our day. Overall we had a fabulous time in London and the Apex was a main part of this. I would like to say a very special thank you to all the staff at the Apex for helping make our 1st anniversary one we wont forget. I would definately recommend people to stay here best hotel Ive stayed at in London","en"
"1784",4,"We spent the night here last night before heading to Paris on the Eurostar. Everything was awesome, however last night was the opening party for the hotel and our roo. Was just above The Booking Office restaurant where the party went loudly on until midnight. We were told that the loud music would stop at 11.30pm at the latest, but it wasn't until I spoke to the hotel manager at 11.55pm that it stopped. If it wasn't for the loud music and the fact we had an early start and I needed to beryl early the hotel would have 5*'s all the way. For Elite members, the executive lounge had a phenomenal breakfast. Will definitely return!","en"

"1786",3,"Myself and the wife were staying here while going to a gig at the Empire. The hotel is a 200m walk from the tube right off the central line. We paid £145 a night with breakfast for a double deluxe room as part of a weekender deal. The hotel is stylish and clean, the breakfast was enjoyable and the staff very friendly. You will find it hard to find a hotel as nice as this for the same money.We didnt use the spa, bar or have an evening meal. The only downside is they secure an extra £50 a night when you book in, this will be returned if you do not use it, but call me old fashioned, I like to pay for what I use. If we stay in London again, this will be the first Hotel we try","en"
"1787",3,"We stayed here for a week in May and then for a few days in June. One cannot expect resort or North American standards in London hotels unless you are willing to pay a small fortune. Our room on the 13th floor was very very small - kept bumping into each other. Sheer drapes were sewn together in the middle and had to be tied up so we could get some fresh (??) air. We upgraded to the 17th floor on our return and room was much bigger. This hotel has some good qualities - the staff were very friendly, good pickup and drop off outside the hotel, pleasant lobby, terrific lounge bar which stays open till 4am and one can get a clubhouse sandwich (hold the egg) up till then. The only negative are the beds - lumpy, slanting like a waterfall,old. Even in our upgraded room they were bad and had a board between the mattress and box spring-the bedskirt parted at one time and the box spring was grubby old ticking. If breakfast is not inlcuded in your room rate they charge 20 pounds per person or $80 C for two. Suggest walking up to Paddington Station (about 6 mins) and go to Garfinkels which is right outside - looking at the Hilton entrance it is on the right. Also the Hilton has a Starbucks - walk through the lobby. Most of London is continuous noise but this location is even more so being close to Paddington Police Station. The wonderful noise of horses clopping down the street to Hyde Park made up for it. Don't forget to go down the road to the Swan pub.","en"
"1788",5,"Spent the Weekend in London with my wife to celebrate our 5th wedding anniversary and mentioned this in my online booking notes. On arrival we were congratulated on the event and asked if we had anything special planned. I mentioned we were going to watch the Lion King and a few other things. We were also upgraded to a Master Suite. Our room (number 534) was amazing - the bed was huge and comfy, and everything was just perfect. And on the dresser was a little box of chocolates and a card congratulating us on our anniversary. When it came time to check out we were asked how our stay was and asked if we enjoyed the Lion King - they obviously make a note of these things. It's little things like that, on top of the perfect rooms, that make Apex Temple Court amazing. We will definitely be back!","en"

"1792",3,"Hotel Russel its self is in a wonderful location in london and very close to a tube station. The hotel is no better than any three star hotels i've stayed in however. the room was very nice and the bed very comfortable but the bathroom of our room was compact to say the least! The biggest and most prominent fault with this hotel however was the staffs attitude. As we were a young couple, they seemed to have a stuck up attitude toward us and we seen them be much more helpful to other hotel residents. Everytime we asked a question we got a minimal answer and disregarded so they could help a more ""wealthy"" looking couple. So as long as you look posh you'll be fine staying here, but if your just a normal down to earth person prepare for an attitude problem!","en"
"1793",3,"London hotels aren't cheap. And we all know you can't swing a cat in the room. I was hoping this one would be a little different but it did disappoint on a couple of levels. The room was so small it was difficult to walk around the other side of the bed. There was a panel on the wall which housed the airconditioning or like that came loose while we were there (they did fix it once notified). It is in a great part of town and the service was good as well....saying that I think we could have done better for the price.","en"
"1794",5,"Having travelled to London on numerous occasions we gave South Place a try based on the TripAdvisor reviews and we weren't disappointed! We received an early check-in and after advising reception we were on a honeymoon we received a lovely plate of strawberries and a hand written note from all of the hotel staff. Very nice indeed. The Secret Garden Bar is surprisingly loud, smoky and small. So avoid at peak times. Angler restaurant is very nice but a little overpriced - this is a Michelin Star restaurant in London though so you get what you pay for. Great location and the biggest surprise is the breakfast in the hotel which was included with our room. The restaurant attached to the hotel is where breakfast is served and you can choose anything from the a la carte menu. The food is outstanding and the best breakfast in a hotel we have ever had. The granola is a must! Staff are very friendly at this hotel and always welcome you when you are returning from a day out in London town. Try this hotel. You will be back!","en"
"1795",2,"We booked Citadines thru a London apartment agency for a recent family trip to London and were quite disappointed. The apartment was very small and well worn. The air conditioning was either not working or turned up very warm. The service was mediocre. We had to follow up to get our one cleaning for the week. We booked for 4 people, but they only gave us 3 bath towels and then made us pay for the extra towels. The people working the front desk were pleasant but not helpful. They missed our wake up call and would not help with a simple request to print a boarding pass for our flight out. It was nice to have a small kitchen in the room to prepare easy meals or breakfast. Overall, I would not recommend this location for families.","en"
"1796",5,"This small hotel was tucked away from busy (and very convenient) King's Cross station on a quiet garden square.

Location was very good; we had stayed near Battersea Park on a previous visit, on the other side of the Thames, and wanted to be near the park again - good for a morning jog or stroll before starting your day. The park is spacious and very beautiful. The Pestana is right across the street from the park -- you can either cross the main road or use the tunnel from the riverside walk, accessible through the walkways of the modern apartment complex that abuts the hotel (though this seems to be closed off at night, so if you go too early in the morning you will find it gated). It is perhaps a mile to Sloane Square where you can get on the Underground, short 20-minute walk. Worth the short walk to the tube, because we found the area to be quiet, and the park is just a lovely, quiet haven.","en"

As other travelers have mentioned, the hotel doesn't have a gym but you can use the gym and pool of its sister property a block away which is fairly large for a London hotel gym. The service was decent although a bit pretentious but I have that view of service in London hotels generally and is probaly my American interpretation of the London service standard. One thing to be aware of is that at checkout they may add a nightly staff gratuity to the bill that you may decline. In all, I would stay here again if I got a good deal.","en"

The downside to this hotel is the bathroom, it is quite small but is clean and newly decorated.

However, I needn't have worried as she was really happy with everything. The room was clean and exactly as described. The only thing was that I had booked a superior 'twin' room and they were given a superior 'double' room...so they had to share a double bed instead of having two singles. If they were planning a longer stay they would have pointed this out, but as it was just overnight they were ok with it. My daughter found the staff very pleasant and helpful, and the breakfast was perfectly adequate. Well situated..and fairly straightforward to get to from Gatwick airport, which was a concern, but all went well. I feel the price I paid for their stay was perfectly acceptable (compared to others), given the location of the hotel and the room that they were given. Would recommend.","en"

The lady that cleaned our room daily was extremely hard working and I commend her to the manager in case you read this review. Breakfast was good, plenty of choice and even though a large volume of people staying we gained our table quickly each morning. We used the pool daily and this was warm and well maintained, although the last morning we were told it was not available. A point lost there I am afraid. Over all a good location and despite the colossal size of the hotel it seemed to manage well. The room temperature was a small matter that needed attending as the heat on the floor we stayed was over warm really.","en"

We opened the window on arrival as room was hot and unable to close again, reported to reception and it was fixed by the time we got back later. Also on returning to hotel on Saturday late afternoon a do not disturb sign was on our room door and a note from cleaners to say as this was on the door they hadn't cleaned our room. The room didn't need cleaning but we had used the towels twice for showers already so we wanted clean ones, again reported to reception and when we got back clean towels on the bed (although used ones not removed and no space to put them in the bathroom) Plenty of shops/bars/restaurants in the area and short walk to tube.

"1815",5,"Stayed at the Premier Inn, Islington for 5 nights and was very pleasantly surprised. Not everything is perfect, but what you get for what you pay is just brilliant. (£70/night) First impression: The staff were all smiles and a joy to communicate with. Check-in was really fast and hustle free. Room: Expected a tiny, crammed space, but was presented with a nice, decent sized room. There isn't a european AC outlet, and the razor adaptor you can borrow from the reception doesn't work with, say, phone chargers. Had to buy one at Boots. Room was very bright, clean and crisp, and smelled nice. HD flatscreen TV. No mini fridge, which I always find a bit disappointing.No safe in the room either, but this doesn't bother me. Bed: They have a ""good night sleep"" guarantee here, which is a bold statement, seeing as the mattress is on the hard side, to say the least. However, the blanket and pillows were lovely and I can't stress how quiet everything was! Also, we were never ""bothered"" by too eager housekeepers in the morning, although our room was always neatly made up when we got back from our shopping etc. Big thumbs up! Bathroom: Not very fancy, but did the job. Enough hot water, but the pressure could be a bit better. Soap dispenser near the sink didn't work, but not a big problem as we just used the one by the shower. Very clean and fresh. Location: Angel/Islington is brilliant, which we already knew having stayed here for our two previous trips to London. 3 min walk to the tube station (Northern line), and there are literally hundreds of cafes/bars/restaurant in the area. Hotel is situated in the back of the main street (thus very quiet), right between the VUE mall and the Design Center. Short trip to the trendy Hoxton and Hackney areas. Conclusion: Some minor flaws which are to be expected, seeing as it is a budget hotel, but compared to what you pay per night, and taking location, service etc into consideration, this is a super hotel!","en"
"1816",5,"Best to book through their own website for exciting offers. Excellent location -next door to the British Museum but on a quiet street. Fantastic service and amenities. We were able to request our Champagne in the bar instead of our room and with the Bloomsbury Weekend offer we could choose which day to have our high tea (which was particularly special with more interesting flavours than you often get). Great choice of tea - my one request would be to offer a peppermint variety. The bed was very comfortable and you are able to request feather pillows and duvets. Staff were very friendly without being overbearing and keen to offer recommendations. Very relaxing atmosphere with music playing and plenty of communal spaces to sit for a rest. Can't comment on the restaurant but breakfast was of an excellent quality and the menu looked very reasonably priced and with something to please everyone. There is a similar menu in the bar but the hotel is within walking distance of pretty much any restaurant in central London. Would recommend to anyone looking for a couple of nights sight-seeing in London or just wanting to relax for a couple of days- there are tempting spa offers and any hotel that offers yoga sessions in your room gets my vote!","en"

"1820",4,"As a seasoned corporate traveller in the UK, I rate this hotel very highly. It is of an excellent standard. I was fortunate to be upgraded to a Priviledge room on the top floor. They have good secure parking - unfortunately no ramp nor automatic doors from car park andso a bit of a struggle with baggage at the rear entrance. However, a very good check in - staff extremely polite and very knowledgeable - very quick. Rooms are superb, well appointed and quality of soft furnishings excellent. As for London, and inparticular this once Police Section House, the designers have had to fit things in in a clever manner. So the en-suite not the largest but fittings and standard excellent. Public areas well appointed, lovely bar and very good restaurant. The standard of customer service by the maitre d' and the waiting staff very good. Breakfast was fine - perhaps bacon and sausgae a little underdone - but otherwise of a god standard. Checkout good and swift. On the whole a very good experience and would recommend. It is a bit of a walk into Greenwich itself, but clearly one of teh best hotels in the vicinity","en"
"1821",5,"I was concerned about this hotel before arriving there for our stay, due to some negative reviews. I was pleasantly surprised, however. We checked in easily and quickly and the staff did not try to ""upgrade"" us to a more expensive room. We had a standard double and the room was perfectly fine. It was a small room, but this is to be expected in European hotels, especially at the price we paid. The room was very clean, and the hotel is close to beautiful Regents Park. It was an easy walk to the Great Portland tube station, which connects to tube lines that take you all over the city. I would definitely stay at this hotel again!","en"
"1822",3,"Let me say I am a Hilton fan. Top ranked on their loyalty programme and clocking up 50 nights in them across the world. However, this hotel has changed that. The initial room I was allocated stank of mould, was tiny and extremely tired. All furniture was badly worn. I had to take a call in the room and whilst doing so unearthed dust on just about every surface! I called down and was asked to come down to be allocated another room. This was a hopeless process as they tried to pass me off a twin room. The room I was allocated was in equal poor repair but at least did not smell, but as the wallpaper was coming off the wall I did call down to speak to the manager. This took 15 minutes to get to speak to the right person. They explained that rooms smelled as they could not open the windows and that a refurbishment was taking place. He stated that the hotel rooms always met Hilton inspection which stunned me as they were in such poor repair. He offered to make it all up to me. Given this was over an hour of messing around and that I was still in a very poor room I expected something significant. The only thing to materialise was two bottles of water and an apple. Given that as a diamond member I am supposed to get this anyway I can only assume that doing nothing was acceptable to them. So in summary, terrible rooms, odour problems, poor management and customer service. You have been warned!","en"
"1823",5,"My wife and I had spend 12 days roaming around England, Scotland and Belgium. For our last two nights in London we wanted to do it up right. I booked a double room with the iconic view and requested an upgrade to the suite. I got the upgrade. What a view from the patio of Parliament, Big Ben and the London Eye. The suite was large, had a small kitchen, large bedroom and modern efficient bathroom. It was the end of our trip and we wanted room to relax and catch our breath before the trip home. The staff was available and efficient and was not constantly asking if we needed anything. Exactly what we need on this stay. Breakfast buffet is excellent with a large variety of items. The one ding I give them is that the carpet could use a good cleaning. My wife and I are already talking bout when we want to come back and staying anyplace else would be a step down.","en"
"1824",4,"We stayed at this hotel as it was close to Hyde Park, where one of my favourite bands were playing- Florence and the Machine. This hotel is ideally placed and is right on the doorstep not only to Hyde Park, but overlooks Kensington Gardens. Also less than a minute around the corner is the Underground. Plenty of shops and restaurants to hand locally, as well as the beautiful parks. The hotel itself is nice and reception staff friendly and helpful. For an extra £20.00 we upgraded to a King room. The view was rubbish, but the room itself was very spacious, with a large King bed. Coffee making facilities, fridge, ironing boad and bathrobes were provided. The bathroom was adequate- not the largest , and the shower was rather small. But towels were for once a good size, so many hotels provide the smallest of towels, but couldn't complain here. A huge air con unit is in the room, so no chance of overheating! What was disappointing was that wifi is not free, unless you are a club member, which my husband is. Unfortunately he did not have details to hand, and the hotel didn't seem to be able to find them either. However, I have stayed in many hotels across the world and most will offer free wifi to their guests. Sadly it seems in my own country we are still a bit mean on that front. So be warned it will cost £4.99 per day. Also the network is not that good and it kept crashing, it will not work either in the bar or restaurant. However, breakfast was included, and a very good selection I have to say. In fact one of the best in my travels. The bar area is very nice and comfortable too. A pleasant place to finish off the evening. All in all a very nice stay, and would definately stay here again.","en"
"1825",3,"Stayed here for 2 nights was in a nice area but seemed out of the way. Close to a few resturants and some little shops. We were attending Hyde Park so this was the closest hotel near we could find last minute that had reservations. Quite modern had a view over the park and comfortable for a sofa bed. There was 3 of us in a 'junior suite' was an average sized room but the facilities weren't hooked up for 3 people only 2 cups and 2 glasses so we ended up sharing and not enough tea or milk and we like our morning cuppa. Went back to the hotel for a evening drink and waited in the bar area for about 10 mins and nobody came even though he walked past us collecting glasses when we realised he wasn't coming we ordered the drinks only to be told 15 mins before closing they were closed which it closed at 12. We spoke to Reception who spoke to him and he said he 'got confused' So we went back into ordering our drinks where he couldn't understand much english and soon got the 1 magners not the 2 he kept repeating. We didn't get breakfast with the price it was £15 each not worth it. It was simple. Your usual fried brekfast, tea and coffee and some cerial. We didn't pay that again the next day we went out and had something nicer and for half the cost. All together was a nice stay.","en"

"1827",4,"This hotel was very comfortable, in a superb location close to Trafalgar Square and many cafes, restaurants and shops. The equipment and facilities are good for an overnight stay and would be even more useful on longer visits. The only quibbles were that the dishwasher worked only intermittently, and one or two of the instruction leaflets were missing or referred to models which were not in the room. Everything was perfectly clean and nicely designed. Staff were mostly helpful.","en"

Public areas are really good and nice level of privacy in the lobby area. Rooms very standard Marriott so you know what you are getting. Fresh fruit in the room is a good touch. Rooms slightly dated and water can take a little while to get hot. Despite its very busy location it feels peaceful and not right in the heart of London. Closet tube is Gloucester Road and 5 mins walk. Well done Marriott for your consistency.","en"
"1831",4,"We booked this hotel through the trivago app and weren’t expecting much for the price we paid (£78 for a double room).The hotel is based off Kings Cross Road, one of the seedier areas but don’t let this put you off if you are looking for a cheap but decent stay in central London. It is just a five minute walk to Kings Cross and St Pancras station and ten minutes from Euston, which makes a great base for exploring the city. The hotel itself is large and relatively modern. The room was of a decent size, basic but spotlessly clean with a comfy double bed. There were tea/coffee facilities, a TV, a good double wardrobe and a small but functional bathroom. We were only looking for a base for sleeping so this was fine for us. The staff was friendly and helpful and the full english breakfast, which was included in the room price, was really good! For the price we paid we couldn’t fault this hotel and will be returning if we want another budget hotel in the city.","en"
"1832",3,"Let's face it the Savoy is an icon worldwide let alone in London and probably somewhere everyone aspires to stay. Some are lucky enough that they can choose to at anytime, the rest of us it is a rare treat. We are lucky enough to be able to visit London regularly and usually stay in Mayfair given it's proximity to most things we like and Green Park tube but this was both mine and my Wife's birthday so thought we would push the boat out. Make no mistake the Savoy is not cheap, it was almost £200.00 dearer than the Mayfair, for that you get Grandiose iconic splendour and old school first rate service. We had a room on the second floor and that was a mistake albeit not our choosing, each night between 10pm and 11pm there was a racket from below us and again one morning between 5 and 6am, it may have been from the street below or the refuse or whatever but no amount of understanding can accept that, then on our last night of two at 1pm an unbelievably loud grinding sound woke us up and a visit to reception was required to ask for someone to investigate and have it ceased. Not at all acceptable in this quality of establishment. The only other gripe is that neither bar could accommodate us for a nightcap post theatre or at anytime because our Son at 12 was not allowed in, a shame, he knows how to behave but I suppose it is their rule. We took their afternoon tea, food really good and service first rate but lacked the drama and ultimate specialness of the Ritz on Piccadilly. Breakfast was excellent albeit I prefer the Wolseley if only because despite the original Arnold Bennett being created at the Savoy, the Wolseley's is vastly superior. We would stay again, maybe as a couple to get the full experience and certainly we would expect a better quieter room as a pre requisite but it is hard to justify the extra cost over the Mayfair hotels, for which you could treat yourself to the aforementioned alternative venues and have change.","en"
"1833",3,"We reserved 2 rooms but only one was ready. This was after 3 PM. Room unavailable was triple. We checked in the one room and returned at 6 PM and still had to wait for housekeeping. Received no compensation for wait. Otherwise hotel was fine with a good location.","en"

"1839",4,"We are regulars at Holiday Inn Expresses all over the UK. We selected this hotel for it's proximity to the tube station at Colliers Wood. It is of the usual standard for HI Express, Clean, good breakfast, nice sized bathroom. The only negative was the traffic noise from the main road which didn't seem to stop all night with sirens and buses etc. We will return as it is nearby where we need to be to visit family, but next time I will request a room away from the front of the hotel so our sleep is not disturbed by traffic noise. The hotel is well located for a couple of shopping centres -Tandem Centre - and for Tooting, and Clapham. Quite a trek from Euston/Kings Cross/ St Pancras but handy for South London.","en"

"1841",3,"I stayed for three nights in a single room. The room was tiny. There was a single bed with less than one meter clearance around it.

Close to two underground lines and there is many, many restaurants near by.","en"
"1842",4,"We had a very good room, with very good bathroom. Friendly people, very clean, etc. The only thing is the noise from the street and the airconditioning from a big building in the street, and we had booked a quiet room. If you close the windows there's no problem, and you can use the airco in the room but we like fresh air better. But the hotel is situated in a very busy square so what can you say? (maybe take earplugs with you) Our room was not too big, but certainly big enough. From other reviews I expected a very small room. I don't know what these people are used too of course. We had breakfast included but otherwise I wouldn't have taken it in the hotel. It is too expensive for what you get. I'm sure you can get better and cheaper breakfast in the city itself, especially when you don't want english breakfast.","en"

Location is great, very short walk to London Bridge tube station which has a very regular service. Breakfast was lovely and the service was really friendly. All in all I would absolutely recommend this hotel as a base in London and I can't wait to go back!","en"
"1844",1,"This hotel is awful. It's old and decrepit and hallways smell some unidentifiable smell. What's worse is the customer service is rude, abrupt, impatient, slow. The first time I called because the TV wouldn't turn on. Front desk said they would come up in 5 minutes to help - she didn't show up until 40+ minutes later, long after I figure it out myself. Next I called for help because the AC wouldn't turn on and London was having a heat wave. Again, no one came for about 40minutes and I was impatiently waiting to go to sleep, it was probably 10:40pm when he showed. He seemed exasperated to be there only to discover the room didn't have a remote which is needed to turn on the AC. When he brought one up and turned it on, he actually wanted to take the remote with him leaving me with no way to adjust the temperature, luckily he relented and let me keep it. Next day when it wouldn't turn on again, he made me go down to the front desk with the remote so he could show me and sounded extremely impatient on the phone, pretty much ""telling"" me to come down, and an abrupt and perfunctory thank you, and hanging up. And when I arrived downstairs was anything but pleasant. The ""free"" breakfast is served in the basement (gross) and when I took a peek I turned right around and left. Oh, and the walls or door are such that I could hear everytime someone walked down the hall or got out of the elevator. This place sucks and worst customer service I've received in a while. Hope this review directs people away from this hotel so they learn this business is not just about providing a bed.","en"

The room was tidy and clean, fair size; though there were not many choices for breakfast, they tasted good. Overall it's a comfortable experience staying here and convenience to reach out for food and bars, would recommend for travelers who want to stay somewhere quiet.","en"
"1850",4,"We stayed in the Hotel for Four Nights in end of August , it was very good. I booked a Standard Room for me, my wife & our infant.

But when I told them about their information in Booking.com & I already request a baby Crib in the room and nobody replies to me that the room not fit with Crip. They made me a free upgrade to a Deluxe Room after the check in & they send their bellboy to assist us to move our luggage’s to the new Room. The check in time was 3:00pm but we arrived early for our early flight arrival 9:00 am & they give us the room ready at 12:00 am. The check in was very smooth, all the staff was very friendly The lobby was very cozy and nice All Rooms we checked in are very nice modern decorated and same style and design but the deferent only in the room size. The standard was 22M & the Deluxe was 33M. The Room & bathroom were vey cozy and modern with very nice Bathroom arrangement.

The kids slept on the sofa bed and we made use of the kitchenette for snacks and meals. Location is excellent. The Southbank is amazing for kids with the attractions and kid friendly restaurants. Getting around is easy with the tube and buses to get anywhere in London. Our flight out was late at night and so were able to get a late checkout for 10 pounds per additional hour.

Although room was small and there were a lot of steps (no lift), the beds were comfortable, beakfasts (included) were tasty, location great (proximity to Hyde Park, tube stops, and eateries), and both Chris and Maria provided a lot of good advice for sightseeing and were able to book tours/arrange for taxis (airport/train station).

I actually arrived a little early and they kindly accommodated this weary traveler...the staff was top notch and the food was good as well. One thing to be aware of: The minibar uses sensors...I had accidentally knocked over a Pringles can and another food item when checking to see if there was enough storage room for my water bottle...and they appeared on my bill.

"1864",3,"I am astounded that this hotel rates so highly in the opinion of so many! Everything bar two things were at best strictly average - the hideous frontage and the Stalinesque inner 'courtyard' upon which our bedroom had the misfortune to spend it's life looking out onto (PLEASE see attached photos) Check in was interesting as we had the audacity to use our very much deserved Airmiles. When as smokers, we found that we had been assigned to a Smokers room, we politely requested a change. Basically, it was indicated that as the user of Airmiles we were in a non-negotiable position. Please for future reference, don't EVER say anything like that to my wife - not if you value your health anyway! Our newly allocated 'up-graded' room, proved to be no different to our original - other than the presence of a recently vacated fridge Other than a hotel in Pisa in which we found that our bedroom view was in actual fact looking onto an inner building space designed for the ventilation system, this was probably the most horrific room with a view I could possibly imagine Also recently stayed in a hotel in Munich which was designed in the style of the 70's - I said DESIGNED - not allowed to linger! I appreciate that some upgrades have been made to this particular Holiday Inn, but to be realistic, it is most unlikely that I shall be visiting to make a new assessment Final point - Airmiles users should be treated with a little less disdain. I am fortunate that I am able to use such a rewards system - because I travel far and wide and on a regular basis - possibly I could in actual fact be one of your most valuable customers rather than some grateful 'free loader'?","en"

The room was very airy and clean, with crisp white bedding, which was changed every 3 days. We were provided with fresh towels every day. The free WI FI was very good which made my son very happy. Breakfast continental and plentiful. There is no lift, so not too good for those who cannot go up stairs and one thing I missed was the land line in the room. Otherwise we were very comfortable.","en"

We booked a middle of the road room. it wasn't small but it was at the back of the hotel with no proper window. it had a window that opened onto a shaft that went down through the hotel to at least let some light in. Didn't bother us for the couple of days we stayed here. Comfortable beds. there are workmen still working on the hotel during the week, (not Sat and Sun) the eletctric drills start at half 8 and we had to call on them to fix our aircon. you get a free continental breakfast to make up for this at the moment. Did the job I suppose and I'm sure it will improve when the work is finished.","en"

"1884",4,"Stayed here over the weekend; faultlessly nice room / bathroom. Service was excellent, and it's very good for access too (exit 8 from Blackfriars practically leads into the hotel). On the downside, as a leisure traveller this was VERY expensive in terms of room service / breakfast / entertainment, etc. £10/movie, £17/buffet breakfast, £20/basic room breakfast, minibar was hilariously expensive [we didn't need to buy a movie as we were having too much fun checking the prices out]. The other slight downside, staying here over the weekend, since it's in the financial district everything is closed ALL DAY Saturday & Sunday. So nice & quiet then, if that's what you're after. By the way, we got it for $100 per night Priceline.","en"
"1885",5,"We stayed here last night after visiting the barbican centre. They had our room ready for early check in and had made it feather free for me (often I have to get this changed once in the room despite this being mentioned in the booking, so that was great. The room was very quiet even with air con (the hotel was surprisingly warm so this was used). The bed was really comfy, the room had a boutique feel (it felt like a real treat to stay there) and so we recommend this for couples looking for a place to stay in London. It's close to the barbican tube stop (a couple of minutes walk) and so is convenient for the circle line. We also had dinner downstairs after the concert, staff were friendly and food excellent. Recommend the moules frites and chocolate cheesecake. Husband didn't rate the beer he chose but my cocktail was nice.","en"
"1886",5,"My husband and I have visited this hotel twice now. It's a gorgeous, contemporary hotel in the City and a great choice for anyone who wants a bit of luxury for a fraction of usual London prices. We've been lucky enough to stay in a suite on both our visits, which are well equipped and have fabulous bathrooms with huge baths and walk-in showers. Staff are always extremely polite and helpful. There was an unexpected problem on our must recent stay and, even though it wasn't the fault of the hotel or staff, they couldn't do enough to apologise and made sure that the message about the problem was passed on to the next shift of staff. Breakfast is expensive, although probably reasonable for London, but it's lovely. I'd recommend the pancakes. The only real downside to the hotel is that it's a bit out of the way. The City can be very, very quiet at the weekends and it's a fair (but pleasant) walk from Waterloo. That said, it's obviously very easy to get anywhere in London so it's not a massive problem. Fabulous hotel for amazing prices.","en"

We will be back for sure.","en"
"1893",4,"First the positives: centrally located (one block away from the British Museum, only a short walk to Soho,...), comparably large rooms (for London), good value for money (for London). now the negatives: breakfast room personal is neither friendly nor competent (the friendliness of the reception personal is okay but nothing more), room floors are carpeted and rooms towards the roads are quiet noisy. I am tempted to give a worse review, but I think that you can easily pay more for less in London than at the Bedford Hotel.","en"

"1895",4,"We stayed in room 5 at the Blandford Hotel after booking on a late rooms website. Even with the discounted rate I was still rather disappointed at the size of our room, which could be described generously as compact, and the fact that it was right next to the reception. That said, the hotel staff were very friendly and helpful, the rooms were very clean and comfortable, and the breakfasts were very good with a pretty good selection on offer. These aspects immediately make it a better option than some of the bigger chains. Having stayed in many London hotels I would happily recommend The Blandford but if staying for more than one night I would pay the slightly higher rate in the hope that the room might be a touch larger.","en"

Air conditioning wasn't working and despite asking and being assured it would be sorted it was not.

In summary the hotel was convenient for our purposes and one of the few options in this part of town","en"
"1900",3,"Okay - so I really LOVE afternoon tea and I chose the Sunborn for its location near to the cable car. The service was very good, the view was excellent - across the dock to the City and beyond, watching paddle-boarders and water skiers on the water (and sometimes in the water!). It was quiet on a Sunday and we had a table at the front of the restaurant with uninterrupted views. So far so good. We ordered ahead for a vegan tea: some very nice vegan sandwiches, followed by sliced melon? No effort to make vegan scones or cake, somewhat takes away the point of afternoon tea. The non vegan afternoon tea was okay - the sandwiches were fine but unexceptional, the scones (plain, one small scone per person with jam from a jar and thick cream) were warm and there were three small cakes each. We had a miniature cream cone, an average brownie and a very good but very small macaron. I was recommended hot chocolate - very good, and it was replenished for free. It felt like the afternoon tea was just for tourists who don't know what to expect. As I said the service and the view were very good but I wouldn't go back for afternoon tea.","en"

"1905",4,"We booked the Crescent Hotel based on it's review in Frommers and because my Husband knew the area very well. I was disappointed from the moment we walked in the front door. First of all there was someone cleaning the windows above the front door. He didnt stop to let us in and I got drenched with water dragging my bags in the door. Then the Russian/Eastern European woman who works the front desk coldly told us we would have to wait until 2:30 to check in because she ""wasn't sure if the room was ready."" I was hot annoyed and sweaty from being on the plane and dragging my bags all over town, so the last thing I wanted on my honeymoon was a rude front desk girl. It only went down from there- the staff is rude- in fact Mrs Cockrel herself was blatantly rude to myself and my husband, the computer room (while nice it is provided) is always full, the beds are hard as rocks and they didnt change the sheets while we were there. They also have very very hard towels and the ones that we were given that were ""clean"" had black smudges all over them. Another annoying thing is that there is rarely anyone at the desk- and forget it if you need someone before 7:00 or after 10:00- we had to make an emergency call because we needed to check out early, so we called at 10:30 and the girl who answered acted like we had called her in the middle of her wedding. The rooms were larger though, and we didnt have any problems with the water flow. The breakfast was nice, but not worth the other shortcomings that this hotel has. There were many many other hotels along the Crescent so I would check those out before I booked here. OH! And it is SUPER loud here. I was awakened by both people above us pounding around and the people who were outside.","en"

"1908",3,"Overall a decent place for people having to use Eurostar, and meet people on business. When booking, it should be clearer that a certain number of rooms have windows that look down only into the lobby, which makes them like ""closets with windows"" and a bit oppressive. These rooms should be clearly indicated, and should cost less than rooms with access to the outside. As there is a policy of ""free for children"", there were just too many screaming and running children at breakfast - and the seating arrangements really should take into consideration the inconvenience of people trying to collect their thoughts for a business meeting against children jumping on the furniture (particularly at 7.30 am) - and seat the families AWAY from individuals who are alone, and obviously on business travel.","en"

The room is an Executive King room and I find it a good size for myself travelling alone and staying more than a couple of nights. Hotel quality is pretty good, although some room items showing their age like the mattress which I reported to the front desk. Location of hotel is fantastic, being only 100m from Gloucester Rd tube and having a good range of dining options nearby. The restaurant in the hotel had nice food, and price was good given I get 50% off with Platinum PGR Rewards. I would happily return here again.","en"
"1914",3,"Stayed for one night, we had a triple and twin room. Both rooms were very hot but clean. The sink and shower did not drain very well. Rooms were very dark as not much natural light from the windows. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was very busy, no table cloth on tables, packed in like sardines in a can. The corridors need some TLC also the sofas in reception could be replaced, very ripped and tatty looking. If you are just needing a bed for the night this place serves its purpose.","en"
"1915",5,"This is quite a new hotel so having stayed in lots of older ones around London it was really nice to experience something modern. The rooms are lovely with very comfortable beds, luxurious bathrooms and big pillows. The views of the power station and dogs home are dramatic/fun. I didn't use much of the services but reception was very polite and efficient. The hotel is easy enough to get to - Sloane Square tube then a two minute bus ride or a 15 minute walk. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again as it's a high quality hotel with nothing I could find fault with.","en"
"1916",4,"Me and my 2 children, 15 and 10 booked a junior suite for 1 night during half term. Kids were extremely happy as we were up graded to a penthouse suite and the view of Big Ben was amazing at night. The bed was comfy but the sofa bed not so comfortable. Room service excellent, breakfast was bought to our room at the requested time with everything and more of what we ordered. Family fun package good because breakfast included for all but unfortunately it didn't include free movies in the room as I thought, apparently I was told on check-in the children had to watch the movies down stairs in the bar, but my kids are too old to do that. Good location 6 mins walk to Waterloo. Plenty of buses and taxis outside. The Italian restaurant was ok, (burn't lasagna) wouldn't want to dine there again.","en"
"1917",2,"Honestly, the front desk staff (especially the one female) made this experience miserable for us. Had she been kind, I would have given 3 out of 5 stars. She had a frown on the entire time, and the few times I was in the lobby using the computer, I heard her arguing with guests. She scolded me for using the hair dryer at the ""high"" setting, as it will blow a fuse (which it did). HOW IN THE WORLD would anyone know not to use a dryer at a high setting?? She acted like I should know better. Then, it cost an additional 10 pounds to run the A/C which we needed as it was a hot day. It barely worked, my sister and I woke up sweating in the middle of the night. Awful. The room was tiny but clean. The bathroom tiny, but clean. We only needed a place to stay for one night, I wasn't looking for anything glamorous. It did the job in that aspect...but I just cannot get past how people can be working in the hospitality industry and be this way. That employee has NO business working at the front desk of a hotel. You can tell she hates what she does and hates people (certainly seems that way). I would NEVER go back to this hotel which is a shame because the area is great, and the hotel itself is a charming old place to stay.","en"
"1918",1,"I statyed for 2 nights at this hotel for business and felt that I had to write this review. Can I start by saying the staff were very nice but the hotel was definately not. The pro was its location which is wonderful for central London Cons - NO WIFI!!!! I was there on business and no wifi was a nightmare! unless I apid 10 euro a day which is criminal 1. I asked for a double but got triple single beds and they were so narrow you risk falling out! 2. The bed shoock everytime a tube went underneath ( and I was on the 4th floor) 3. There were dirty towels left behind the bath room door 4. The enamel was pealing off the bath making it look dirty and very unappealing 5. The toilet is what I can only assume was a closet and has no heating and an old fashioned pull chim which comes down via a hole in the plasterboard roof 6. Breakfast was tinned fruit cocktail and as I dont eat wheat that was all I could have and yogurt 7. the coffee was undrinkable I will not be back and I do not recommend. Given the price I expected a lot better!","en"
"1919",3,"Reception was chaos when we arrived, no one in Foyer instructing people which queue to join (we chose the wrong one). Staff on reception didn’t seem too worried about the situation. Two twin rooms were booked, however, two doubles were allocated. Fortunately I had printed all my booking details. Had to wait 2 hours past check in time for rooms to be ready. Although drinks vouchers were issued to us but it did reduce our time for other plans. We weren’t given advice on how to get the lifts to work, or told what time breakfast was or where it was. We expected a Guest book in the room giving this info, but there wasn’t anything at all in either rooms 1027 or 912. The size of the room, although smallish, was adequate. The bathroom door was on rollers which was quite loud at night. Room 912 has off the rollers which was reported but not repaired. The extractors did not work either. On our first night we couldn’t get in as the battery had gone on the door lock, but this was dealt with reasonably quickly. The breakfast, when we found it was very nice. A large selection of everything being constantly restocked, even a chef cooking omelettes whilst you waited. Although we didn’t have to wait too long to be seated at 8am, by 9am on Sunday the queue was very long when we left so go earlier if possible. The rooms were clean and tidy and the beds were very comfortable. There is also a secure luggage store at the front door so you can check out and collect it later. The location, just by the Gloucester Road tube station was good and taxis were often parked outside. This hotel was a bit hit and miss and I don’t feel I would book it again. I would however, look at other hotels in the vicinity and try them.","en"

"1924",5,"Choose this hotel immediately - it's the best hotel I've ever been to. Stayed with my mom for 5 nights to explore London for the first time (I'm 22). To be honest, this hotel was my favorite part of my visit!! First of all, the service is way beyond first class! Needed a new room change, printing items, searching for restaurants, recommendations on the city...and much more. I think all of our questions and need for assistance was perhaps a little too much, but the staff was always able to provide the best information with a smile. To add to my travel experience, I ended up losing my passport! The hotel staff asked for all possible places I may have lost it and called/searched for us 24/7. Every time I saw them, they were calling again and again. They told me, ""Enjoy your trip in London. We'll call for you."" I wouldn't have seen the city if it weren't for them! Ended up needing an emergency passport and they helped me from start to finish in getting prepared for the U.S. Embassy visit. Three names in particular came out on top for myself: Monika, Remus, and Frederic - they are kind, hard-working, hospitable, polite, and EVERYTHING else. Not only are they hotel staff, but they are concierges, tour guides, and have now become great friends of mine. My stories revolve around this hotel. Period. If you want to know what it feels like to live like a royal, come here! Next, the decor is elegant, and classy. Tthe food was delicious. Service was impeccable. Location was near everything. They have snacks available for free during the day and evening. Morning paper delivered - your choice. They can customize breakfast for you. We came in late on our first night and were starved..again, the hotel staff was there to save us. I could go on and on, because it truly made my entire trip memorable. The passport incident really surprised me in how much they did. I will never forget this group, the hotel, and will be running back to this hotel for another London trip next year. Wouldn't stay anywhere else. I wish all hotels and other hotel staff learned from Hotel 41. Thank you, Hotel 41!!","en"

"1926",4,"I stayed at the Chesterfield Mayfair for only two nights. Most guests seemed to be there because of leisure reasons. A lot of couples, even quiet young, probably trying to get a 5-star hotel experience which is not as expensive as the Claridge's or the Dorchester. The hotel itself is oldfashioned designed, making you feel like London in the pre-war times. Staff is very attentive and always helpful. Especially Front Desk Team is friendly and always available for assistance, even if the Lobby is a very stressful spot to work at, as it is very small and during the day and evening extremely busy and always crowded! The Barkeeper was very helpful in suggesting a good drink! The room was on the smaller side, but which one in London isn't? Large flat screen tv, complimentary internet, A/C - everything you need! Only disadvantage was the breakfast. It was very boring, staff was not able to handle all guests and the buffet was rarely fully stocked, there was always something out and not refilled for quiet some time. Anyways, the rates are extremely good for the service, the hardware and the location. I'd always stay again there!!!","en"
"1927",5,"Henry VIII hotel is a very good solution, if you're looking for a relatively low-budget but decent accomodation in always exciting London. The hotel is very good located, just off Bayswater road, very close to Hyde Park and underground (Queensway, Bayswater) and bus stations. Especially, line 94 bus is very convenient for Marble Arch, Oxford Circus and Picadilly Circus, i.e. for almost the best attractions in London. The neighbourhood (Queensway) offers almost everything (restaurants, shops, money exchange, cafes, super markets etc.). Lively Notting Hill (Portobello road) is within walking distance. The rooms were very very small, but also very clean and relatively well equiped. Breakfast was not quite satisfactory, in terms of variety and quality, not for a 4-star hotel, anyway. The staff was very polite and helpful, though not always very fluent in English. In general, I keep good memories from my stay in Henry VIII hotel and I wouldn't mind stay there again, for a moderate price, of course.","en"
"1928",5,"We arrived just in time for check in to be met with a smile at the Reception Desk. The service at this hotel was great - nothing was too much trouble and even staff you met in corridors smiled and said hello throughout our stay. The room itself was great as was the bathroom - not huge nor too small (cosy!) with all the mod cons you would expect (kettle, TV, hairdryer etc.) and a few bonus extras (free Wi-fi, free fresh milk/water bottles and mini-breakfast consisting of a banana, yoghurt and orange juice). The room was facing the back of the street so the view was not that great and we had to keep the curtains shut for privacy as the building overlooked an office building next door - however, we were only in the room to sleep really as we were visiting to see London and not the room! The other downside was for a double room for two people, there was one hand towel and one bath towel (althoguh I am sure the hotel would have supplied more upon asking)...I just think they should have had 2 of each ready for use without having to ask. We had breakfast at the hotel the following morning and all was good with great service once again and a good range of food available. The one thing that I would change here was the tea - I like my tea hot and at £2.50 per cup, I am expecting either a teapot or a mug... I instead got a lukewarm small cup of tea which ended up costing £5 on the bill - not really worth it. However, would I stay here again? Yes... it was very close to Old Street underground station which is a little out of the way of central London with all the attractions, but many of these are within 5-15 mins away on the tube so it is ideal in terms of staying in London at a reasonable cost.","en"
"1929",5,"Stunning entrance, wonderful doorman and concierge. Efficient reception staff. Prompt collection from staff with luggage (do a early check in and they look after it.) The rooms are traditional, stylish and classy. The view from the bedroom is amazing showing the London Eye and all the beauty of the river at night. The bathroom is stunning with TV in the bath and a extra large shower head which was heaven. The toiletries are Elemis products and they are wonderful. The bed linen is the finest and the bed has the best mattress i have ever slept on. I actually checked the mattress as it was so comfortable! There was great air conditioning, The internet too was efficient and a iPod docking station to listen to music. The location is close to the theatres and a beautiful park to read in . The food is exceptional and the terrace is a must as you can eat your breakfast outside. You get given your newspapers and you can relax and eat breakfast and with every course available you can eat enough not to eat until late in the day. The staff go out of their way and make you feel like you are special. I am saving up now to go again for a special birthday. Location so good... I cannot fault this hotel wonderful!","en"
"1930",4,"Doormen with top hats and long coats. A nicely appointed hotel overlooking a patch of green in a high end neighborhood in London. A block from Oxford street and two from a tube station. A small and comfortable high end cocktail bar called ""The Luggage Room"" off of the lobby with some expert and pricey mixology on display. We did not try the Gordon Ramsey restaurant attached to the hotel. There are several nice eateries, cafe's and so on nearby. Very safe neighborhood. The room and bathroom was spacious and clean. Service was reserved and polite.","en"

We've spend a few hours also in the swimming pool and sauna and there is not much I can find to improve. Staff is very friendly and always willing to help and find an immediate solution. We had an upgrade to the executive level so all facilities of the executive launch available. The food, as well breakfast as the brasserie in the hotel are to be recommended. For a hotel of this quality and pricing, WiFi should be free in the rooms as well. Not only in the executive launch.","en"

Also within walking distance to Parliament, Big Ben, London Eye, Thames River, Trafalgar Square, Buckingham Palace to mention a few. Also close to HALAL eateries.","en"
"1933",3,"I stayed at this hotel because it said it was less than 2 miles away from The Millenium Dome (02 stadium) which may be true but you cannot walk there, you can see it clearly from the hotel but you have to pay for a full day travel underground ticket to go one stop!!! which seems alittle excessive when theres 4 of you paying £24 to go 2 miles! Anyway, the hotel was good, clean and spacious. However, the tariff listed at reception read an amazing £190 per room per night! wow im so glad we went on the following web site and got a deal for £50 a night...[--]!

Amazingly big rooms (with wooden floors - excellent for allergic people) and stylish furniture, with everything you need in it! Besides, the indoor swimming pool is simply incredible. The tube is also very nearby which offer a direct connection to London City centre. On the less positive side: the neighborhood is not too great and we would appreciate a bigger restaurant with a better choice of food for the kids.","en"

Nice foyer and meeting area where you can conduct meetings and there is a free internet computer with printer available just outside the lifts. Taxis out the front in the morning and great restaurants and pubs near by. Free internet in room made it very easy to get on web...","en"
"1938",3,"Stayed here for business - 5 nights. The hotel is basic and a little tired. My first room was in the basement so dark stuffy hot I went back to reception and the changed it. The second room - I thought was going to be great was at the front with a huge window facing the street. This would have been ok if the window was not broken open with the crazy traffic almost 24 hours going past. No sleep and very tired I got showered had breakfast packed my bag and went to reception to ask to swap rooms, reception were helpful and on my return that evening I got my 3rd room. This was standard but no internet connection. O well I managed to sleep at least.","en"

"1941",3,"Stayed here for only one night. My opinion is that it is overpriced and not that enjoyable. I stayed at the time when there was refurbishments going on and the reception was so small you had to squeeze round with your luggage. The spa was closed, so I was extremely disappointed about that. It was nothing special, and 5* hotels are supposed to give that edge. I wasn't feeling it. And the information on booking was misleading as half the hotel was closed. Disappointing hopefully they sort it out after the refurbishments and I might try this place again.","en"
"1942",3,"The real selling point for this hotel is location. Just a short stroll from the Jubilee line and DLR, it is perfect for Docklands, O2, Greenwich and Stratford. But, while this would have been the height of style when first opened, the hotel is rather tired. It is very clean and clearly well maintained, but needs a refresh to bring it into the modern age.","en"
"1943",4,"I booked a twin room at Dolphin hotel but, once there, we where given a room in Shakespeare hotel(same owner I think). We had a spacious triple room at the ground floor with a beautifull view on the quiet park of the place. The room was clean, with tea and coffe facilities and a fridge. Breakfast was basic but ok with friendly staff. The position was perfect, next to Paddington station, to many bus stops, shops and restaurants.","en"
"1944",4,"Great stay. Short walk to Underground (Tower Hill is best). Close to the heart of the City and all the new buildings going up, some interesting, others less, but interesting to see. Just beware that many businesses & shops in this area are closed on Saturdays & Sundays.","en"
"1945",4,"This is a great place to stay in central london, if you are looking for an AAA location great value. Rooms are a little small, and the bathroom is not much more than a shower cubicle with a toilet and sink. But really, what else do you need? I paid £60 for the night at Christmas time, booked through Agoda, there are no additional extras to pay, so I was very happy to have the towels, TV and wifi all thrown in. The location is brilliant, next to Waterloo stn and North Lambeth Tube on the Bakerloo line so you go directly to piccadilly and Oxford street. The houses of parliament and the London eye are 5 mins walk away. Tune hotels claim that the beds are 5* but really, they are not at that standard, nevertheless they are comfortable and adequate. I am sure that if you are looking for faults you'll find them, but for this price, in this location you really can't complain.","en"
"1946",4,"Situated on Grosvenor Square about 50 yards from the Ameraican Embassy and a 5 minute walk from the central line at Bond Street and even less than that to the shopping extravaganza that is Oxford Street the Milleniums's location is great for both the West End and The City. Ask for a high floor overlooking the square but beware the rooms (mine was 621 are rather musty). The whole place feels like it could do with a refurb but the staff are excellent as is the breakfast buffet, eggs other than scrambled are prepared on demand. Dinner is good but the Table d'hote, 2 courses £18 and 3 for £22 stops at 7.30 and then the prices become rather more W1 and the ambience doesn't justify the cost. My room cost £148 inc breakfast which felt about right if not brilliant, this wouldn't be my first choice but I would go again.","en"

I would also eat lunch or dinner at the wonderful Vapiano restaurant which is opposite the hotel and serves great pasta and pizza.","en"
"1949",5,"Recently stopped at this hotel during half term. Great place as a base. Nothing flash but I thought all the staff were helpful and polite. The rooms were very clean, with good bathroom toilet area. The rooms were cleaned everyday even on a short stay. I was pleasently suprised by the good standard of cooking on the breakfast service. There was a good selection of various choices of breakfast and the staff were really nice. If you want a base in the middle of London that is good value this is it. BUT this is not the Yorkshire Dales it can be noisy on the streets and I suppose the hotel could be depends on other guests. Roll the dice!!!!!!!!!!!","en"
"1950",5,"No problems whatsoever with service, staff were friendly and helpful at all times. The room was very modern and stylish, but most importantly it was comfortable. There were some odd looking books we found above the tv that seemed out of place but they did not affect what we though of the rest of the room. The bathroom was shower only, but still no complaints. Location of the hotel was great as it was only 3 minutes away from Barbican station - which is very handy if you have a lot of bags! Only slight downside was that we didn't have a great view... just the behinds of other buildings in the surrounding area.","en"
"1951",4,"we stayed one night in this hotel. Very well situated in Covent Garden. Good value for money. However the roms are very small which has to be expected. Room very fonctional and imaculate. The only negative was the breakfast which was very poor. There are plenty of coffee houses close by which would be a much better alternative.","en"
"1952",2,"Good location, close to the tube, main road (buses & taxis) and the London museum quarter. We arrived with a one year old wanting to be fed and having booked 3 rooms but none were ready. Staff were friendly but not too interested in speeding up the process. Requested infant cot, got a cot bed. Room was a good size but hotel is a rabbit warren of narrow corridors with numerous fire doors and only one working lift - not the place to negotiate passage with a stroller. Room service was poor, had to ask 3 times in one day to have the room cleaned.","en"
"1953",5,"I stayed with my family from June 16th to June 22th. The location is amazing, near Trafalgar Square and Charing Cross train / tube stations. VERY accesible. The apartment we rented was spacious and the kitchen well equipped (we asked for a larger pot and by the time we came back, it was in our apartment that same day) The internet connection was good and we were able to stay in touch with our family back in Argentina All the staff was very helpful and kind. Some of them spoke Spanish, which was a plus because my parents don't speak English.They even send me a bottle of wine and chocolates for my birthday. I'm recommending this hotel to all my friends and fmaily for they stay in London and I'll definetly be chosing it again for my next visit to this amazing city. Thanks for making my first visit to London (and my birthday too) an incredible experience.","en"
"1954",5,"We have stayed before, it is always a delight, and this time was for my husband's birthday. It is a quiet hotel in a lovely side street in Bloomsbury. You are right next to the British Museum, easy walking of the National Gallery, Trafalgar Square, Covent Garden, and there are plenty of restaurants and pubs in Bloomsbury too. The service at the Montague is exceptionally good, you are made to feel very welcome. Nothing feels ""corporate"" here, it has a quintessentially English feel. All the staff, doormen, cleaners, waiters, reception staff, managers are polite, helpful, and charming. We requested a room on a higher level of the hotel - it feels better to us than being on the ground floor. This time we tried the small double room - a tiny bit too snug for us so we will go back to a bigger double room next time. Breakfast is lovely, and although we didn't eat other meals here on this visit, we have had teas, lunches and dinners here before - all good.","en"

"1956",1,"I have booked a one bedroom classic apartment two month in advance. As soon as I arrived I was asked to leave a deposit of £1000 as a guarantee even if the apartment was fully prepaid!!! The card did not work at reception and I was waiting for over 2 hours with my 2 children. Reception was keeping me informed that my card was not working and that they would not let me in. After calling my bank, suddenly the found out that they where using the wrong machine and that was the reason why the Amex card was not working. There was no apologize for the inconvenience caused. Nothing! The day after, they where towels missing and I called reception but I had to pick them ip myself at reception as there was no housekeeping or someone else to bring me one. As soon as I arrived at reception, the receptionist, the porter and another staff member where chatting nicely at reception. Great! This is not a 5 star unit and certainly not a 5 star service. On departure i was informed that a Taxi called by the reception to Victoria station would cost £25; i have paid £9 for one that was passing by as soon as i left the hotel. I travel very often to London and i will never ever stay here again. Staff could not care less, service is unacceptable and staff is very rude and not willing to help.","en"

"1961",2,"This is an expensive hotel. We turned up for a wedding and were really impressed by the foyer. Huge, gothic, very cool. However when we got to the room (343) it was small and pokey. The bathroom hadn't been cleaned properly, the towels were damp and greyish. The window looked out onto what appeared to be an interior courtyard which gave the room a dull almost cloying feeling. The bed was comfortable but the constant hum of the air conditioning or the hotels electrics was loud enough to keep me awake. The corridor outside also had a strong damp smell. Over priced and disappointing. Passable breakfast.","en"
"1962",4,"Julian the Night Manager was very helpful and also informative on the local area, nothing was too much for him to do for us. To be fair all the staff were very caring and lovely- a real asset to the hotel. The rooms are small, yes, but they are well-facilitated and the breakfast is well worth having. It looks like an affordable, very close version of The Ritz! We will be staying here for the third time in the future for sure!","en"

Our room rate included a continental breakfast, and whilst basic was certainly a very good value add.","en"

"1967",2,"Hotel website made this hotel look fab. Room with 2 beds booked for my daughter & me for a New Year visit, shopping etc. Initially shown to a room with 1 bed, when was expecting to see 2 double beds at least(Holiday Inns have 2 double beds in their 'twin rooms') No such luck. Then allocated a room with 2 narrow & uncomfortable single beds, that had no mattress protection and a sofa bed. Why? It was late so put up with it for now. Breakfast was a shambles; continental included. Had to queue for at least 15 minutes; staff totally disorganised, wandering about doing very little when there were tables needing clearing & relaying. Food OK if you could get to what you wanted but buffet layout ridiculous & mixed up cooked & non cooked food, juices & toast machine so people just pushing in everywhere. Asked if any rooms with larger beds but told the hotel was full (Monday 30 December) and nothing else available. Went shopping to return to room some 3 hours later to find in process of cleaning & maid had plugged her phone into my charger! She did attempt to apologise - English not her mother tongue - her supervisor might need to get in touch & her battery low. Really? Toilet paper very poor quality, not what I would have expected in a 5* hotel at all. Bar area where food served never clean - dirty tables & rubbish on the floor just left. It was hardly busy. No excuses. Would not recommend this hotel.","en"
"1968",4,"Stayed a long weekend at the Marriott with wife, son & nephew. Reception staff and doormen very pleasant and cheerful.......nothing seemed to be a problem. Check in was very smooth and easy. Room was beautiful with very comfy bed and luxury bathroom and very clean. We had 2 rooms on the second floor, but was slightly disappointed with the view overlooking the atrium of the reception. Would have preferred a room with London skyline view. We spent most days in London, which meant a half hour tube ride each way, but it made staying at a very good 4 star hotel at a decent price worthwhile. The DLR stop is right outside the hotel, or the Jubilee line Canary Wharf station is 5 minutes walk. We didn't eat at the hotel as it seemed quite pricey, but for breakfast, we went to the Weatherspoons, or or there were a couple of decent cafes in the Canary Wharf shoppping centre 5 minutes walk away. Plenty of bars around Canary Wharf, or the hotel had a nice lounge for a drink. Overall, I would book this hotel again for a trip to London.","en"

The bathroom was especially clean and nicely renovated, but very small. The staff were very helpful and friendly (just don't try to use the internet on the TV option). No A/C and because we were on the ground floor we couldn't leave the windows open. The fan was adequate but really noisy. You might want to take an eye mask: the hotel's outdoor light shone directly into the room. We recommend the hotel but suggest you ask for a upper floor room. The internet rate (in advance, non refundable) was a good deal. We paid 169 GBP for a triple for 2 nights.","en"

Big Ben, Westminster Abbey, House of Parliament, The London Eye, Churchill War Rooms, The Banqueting House and so much more within walking distance, and Buckingham Palace a mere 15 minutes away. The Westminster Metro station and Westminster pier are across the bridge. A few restaurants in the hotel itself, and although their breakfast was pricey, it was convenient with a great array of items to choose from, especially on the mornings that it rained, although the selections didn’t change much. If you have any special orders for breakfast, they will take care of it with no fuss at all. The room was a superior room overlooking the atrium, with a glimpse of the Houses of Parliament. The room had a big bathroom, with large bathtub, but tiny shower. Good water pressure though. Check in was relatively quick, and we are now Club Carlson members, and am glad to note that they have hotels in Budapest and Prague, our next stop. I would definitely stay here again.","en"

I stayed a week, and was happy to be in the neighborhood where normal people went about their days, not just wandering tourists. It's really close to hyde park, which is excellent for running. It was nice to be in a budget hotel, in a funny little room, and with nice guys at the desk every time I was coming or going. I would recommend it!","en"

Having paid for an Executive Room, there were no slippers, dressing gowns nor drinks in the empty minibar and a faulty heater that could not be turned off resulted in an unpleasant, sleepless night.

My other 2 favorites are the Ham Yard and the Soho, they are the 3 best in London, so the type of room you can get may help you decide. Staff is impressive and get anything done faster than anywhere else. They adapt effortlessly to each client, although those hotels are definitely targeting media types 30-50. Vibe is quieter than at the other Firmdale properties, and the 18m pool is stunning. Location is unbeatable. Definitely worth the extra pounds compared to slightly cheaper hotels.","en"

"1980",3,"Originally stayed at this hotel as I had bought some tea for two vouchers here and decided it would be nice to see the hotel side too. The hotel was in great distance of all London things we wanted to do!! Right up the road from Harrods, Harvey Nichols and all the expensive shops of Knightsbridge, and lovely Hyde Park. Literally a two minute walk from the nearest tube station. I wouldn't say I was blown away by this hotel, the room was nice, clean, spacious. The only thing I can fault is how cold it was at night and I couldn't find any extra blankets in the room, I'm sure if I had have asked on reception they would have provided some. We were on the top floor so no noise above us thankfully. There is a mini fridge with snacks in, SO SO SO expensive when you can nip to a Tesco extra or co-op nearby and pay 5 times less!!! Big bathroom with shower/bath. We had breakfast included the next morning, which wasn't at all that amazing. We were unsure whether we had to sit down and be served, or whether it was help yourself buffet style. We stood around in the small (very small!) dining area which was just a handful of tables to be honest, waiting to be seated. Eventually we were seated and were told we help ourselves to breakfast, a choice of breads, cakes and cereals, along with juice, water, milk and tea and coffee. Later that day we had afternoon tea for two with Prosecco booked, we booked in at 1pm and rushed back from the museum not wanting to miss our place in case it was busy. When arriving back at the hotel it was so quiet and dead. We approached the receptionist with our vouchers for the tea for two and was told to find table in the dining area. We were then approached by two waitresses, not to be rude but their English wasn't the best, but they were learning! We were brought a stack of sandwiches and cakes, although the cakes were the same as the ones served at breakfast, very dry!!! We didn't touch them. The scones were so small and were gone in a mouthful. We had to ask for the Prosecco as it wasn't served straight away. I found the whole experience quite awkward as we couldn't really communicate with the staff and they were just hovering around looking for things to do by the looks of it. I would NOT pay full price for the afternoon tea, it was such a disappointment, I think it was something like £65 for two, not worth it at all. Overall, average hotel in a great area for discovering London. Top floor room (number 50 something) seems a good choice.","en"
"1981",3,"I didn't expect much based on the reviews. And it was average at best. A poor reception; this place is not big on service. No hot water in the morning, so went down to reception who 'couldn't promise anything' but managed to provide a clean room with hot water for a shower. Breakfast was only continental (all cold) and was in my opinion below average in it's offering. All in all disappointing, I'll go to a name I know next time for hot water and something hot for breakfast.","en"

Location a few mins walk from Waterloo Station- we parked at Train Station and walked across. Bar open 24hrs. Restaurant inside hotel. Food until 11pm. Breakfast busy but was amazing with the self service choice/cereals/pastries/full cooked etc.. We enjoyed our stay and we will book to come back as it met all out requirements.","en"
"1983",4,"Very friendly and helpful staff, the room was clean and the hotel was very quiet, even though it was next to a mainline railway. Close proximity to Bethnal Green underground made getting around London very easy. Would thoroughly recommend for anyone who wants a very cheap but high standard of hotel for their money. Will definitely be staying again on our next trip","en"
"1984",4,"Stayed there for two nights in the middle of October. Clean hotel, the breakfast was fantastic, and the location is great: 10 min walk to Oxford Circus (shopping), 1 min walk to the tube, 4 min walk to another tube station (with other transfer options). Only minus would be that there was always a line at the reception, even when they had 8 people behind the desk (!). Also, their carpet-cleaning left a weird smell in the hallways. The rooms were clean and decent size compared to other London hotels, but still smaller than what Americans (or Scandinavians) usually expect. Worth a 4 star, and about £130 a night for a double.","en"
"1985",2,"We spent a few hours trying to find something nice or desireable about this hotel. When we arrived at the hotel our first impression was ""oh dear"" not very impressive at all, our disappointment continued..... when we saw our ""refurd"" room we almost died, the sink was broken, the shower was almost stuck to the wall, the paint we peeling off the windows, and our room was overlooking the air con and the hotel boilers it was so noisy, in the end we had to ask for another room whih was another £40. The staff at breakfast was unfriendly they spent most of the time breaking the plates This hotel is far too EXPENSIVE for what it is, certainly not 4* Oh yes, good location","en"
"1986",3,"The signal beds in the family room were extremely uncomfortable. You could feel the springs just by running your hand across the mattress and laying on it was very difficult. Not much sleep had.","en"
"1987",5,"I stayed at this hotel for a week during a business trip. This hotel has a modern, fun design and decor. The inner courtyard is beautiful and the rooms are cozy, but very clean , modern and well designed. The towels are very fluffy and the bed/window nook is very soothing. The hotel staff were always cheerful and helpful.","en"
"1988",4,"Excellent location for theatre, Shepherd Bush Empire (when it reopens) and of course the enormous Westfield shopping centre. Situated behind gates off the main road and near the tube. Warm welcome at reception. Room was rather small but clean. Bathroom minute but functional with a good shower. Fridge, coffee making facilities and free wifi are all provided and there is an excellently stocked and reasonably priced bar at reception. Instructions on how to operate the heating/cooling system would have been helpful but the windows do open. A good priced room for London.","en"
"1989",5,"I don't rate many hotels with 5 stars. For me a 4 star can still be an excellent hotel. The Four Seasons Park Lane perfectly fits what I am looking for in a five star hotel. The rooms, public spaces, location, and for me fitness center are all clean and well kept. What sets this hotel apart is the obvious effort to provide a good customer experience. That seems to permeate the staff from top to bottom. Check in was simple and fast. They tried to make me feel as though the few times I have stayed there, maybe 4 or 5, allowed for a level of informality and friendliness that I wouldn't expect. The great service extended to small things. House keeping saw that I was drinking a lot of water. They left extra water even though I could have purchased extra water from the mini bar. I left my laptop on my desk one morning when housekeeping came by to clean my room. The woman cleaning my room left me two small screen cleaning towels. Given how dirty my laptop gets I kind of laughed. The next day I took my laptop with me. The cleaning woman must have seen that I used the towels the day before so she left me a couple more. I might be wrong but when I see a number of employees take extra steps and show some initiative in an effort to make your stay better, I tend to attribute that to a good management team. 24 hour fitness room.","en"
"1990",5,"We stayed for three delightful nights and am already looking forward to going back. The ambiance, the staff, the rooms - all superb/top of class. We were originally planning on staying in the Corinthia (which is also a delightful hotel in a great location), but I'm really glad we stayed at the 41. Due to its offering (particularly the size and ""homely"" feel) it is a really unique proposition in London. I really haven't come across anything similar before and will now not be looking to stay anywhere else when in town.","en"
"1991",5,"Booked this hotel as going to two shows, the lion king at the Lyceum and war horse at the new national theatre. Hotel was walking distance to both. The hotel was also a short walk from Holburn tube station so was ideal for our journey to and from Gatwick airport. The hotel was under construction so were offering a complementary breakfast which was good. They also had a vending machine with beer and wine (had a code that had to be entered to get this) The room was clean and modern. The late 12 noon checkout was ideal as there wasn't the usual rush to pack. Have no complaints about this hotel and will use again","en"
"1992",4,"I stayed at the Vancouver Studios when on business in London as a result of the previous reviews. I found it very friendly and homely while avoiding B & B feel. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the room was clean and while it wasn't huge, it was a decent size for London. I'd definitely stay again as it's ideally placed five minutes walk away from Bayswater Tube and with a shopping centre close by. I was on the fourth floor and there were plenty of stairs to climb to get to it. Not a problem for me but if you've got any difficultly on with modility I'd suggest you ask for a room on the lower floor. A great find for the price!","en"
"1993",5,"Having been impressed by the TripAdvisor reviews, booked this 2-night stay back in the summer on a Travelzoo B&B deal. A wonderful stay! Very handy location for sightseeing around central London. Lovely room on the 9th floor - go for the upgrade when you book! Very quiet. Well worth it. Bed was one of the best we've ever slept in. Facilities high quality. Separate sitting area and bathroom spacious. Appreciated the nice touch from the hotel in having the chocolate cake in the room on our arrival to mark our 25th Wedding Anniversary. Staff diligent, polite and friendly. Food was of an excellent standard both in Brasserie Joel - try and get their £1 Facebook monthly deal (only one plat de jour, however!) - and the expansive breakfast. If still hungry (and want to save some money!) the Costcutter all night store on York Road towards Waterloo was the best option nearby that we found. Park Plaza Westminster Bridge was a memorable experience for all the right reasons! Very highly recommended!","en"
"1994",5,"This hotel is within walking distance of Gloucester Rd tube station & Harrods & near 74 bus stop which takes you up to Marble Arch. The staff were very helpful, the breakfast was good & our twin room was a duplex suite! Amazing value for money. Would stay again.","en"
"1995",3,"Stayed here for two nights for a business trip. Chose Holiday Inn because of the location on Picadilly, hard to beat. Green Park station and bus stops next door. Appearance is a bit 80's style, rooms are shabby (at least those not renovated). Wallpaper pealing off and furniture shows the age. But we realized this, this seems to be standard in most London hotels (except Marriott). The biggest plus of this house is the service attitude of staff. When we realized, that rooms in our room could not be opened, they looked for another room and served free drinks in the meantime. At the same night I realized, that I left my Ipad in the original room. Reception staff and housekeeping promised, that it was not found. Finally I decided to knock at the door of this room and asked the couple in there, if they found an Ipad. They said NO. So I told them, i will call police the next morning. Guess what, returning to my room telephone rang and the guy told me - surprise - they found it under the bed. HA! I told reception, that I found it and that it was my own fault to lose it. Nevertheless the night manager showed up and apologized, the maid should have checked the room before it got assigned to other people. Although I told him, it was really my fault, they got us fruit and drinks. This is really outstanding service. So, overall. Hotel is not bad. Perfect location, great staff, rooms in need of renovation. If location is your preference, highly recommend Holiday Inn Mayfair. Take in mind, most windows cannot be opened.","en"
"1996",5,"I was very impressed with how the lounge operated at the London Andaz. The concept is a great one – no compartmentalized desks, no phones ringing, and everyone ready and willing to help with anything. At the London Andaz, from Karim’s greeting when I first arrived weary from a red-eye flight to an efficient check in sitting relaxed in a chair (no waiting at a desk), my arrival was flawless. When I went back down to plan my appointments for the next day and get some maps, the lounge person helped me plan a smooth day with patience and knowledge. THe restaurant staff is helpful and friendly. Even the painter was friendly. The best example of empowered service I saw occurred when I asked Sami if he had an envelope or folder to carry papers to my appointments that day. He said yes, then looked around, and then lent me the leather folder he uses on the floor. He removed his papers and made my day smoother. The hotel is right next to the Liverpool St. tube station – very convenient. I used to be in the hospitality business, and was refreshed to see a whole new approach to guest service executed so well. I recommend this hotel to anyone doing business in The City of London.","en"
"1997",4,"Marriott comforts near the Edgware Rd. The only complaint about this hotel is the location. The closest tube station at Marble Arch is a ten to fifteen minute walk but there are several bus lines nearby. The huge majority of nearby restaurants are Middle Eastern as are the hookah bars. It is an easy walk to the Wallace Collection and Selfridges. For inexpensive clothing needs and accessories try the Primark on Oxford Street. The staff is professional and helpful. We enjoyed the concierge lounge and the delicious breakfasts in the lounge or downstairs in the restaurant. Three of us shared a room with a king bed and a pull-out sofa. We should have asked to change our room or order a roll-away bed as the sofa was broken and painful for sleeping.","en"
"1998",3,"We enjoyed our stay in the weekend before christmas. Nice rooms, good beds, great location, really friendly staff, good wifi. A 5 minute walk from leicester square and a 5 minute walk to covent garden. We would definitly stay here again and recommend it to our friends.","en"
"1999",5,"Beautiful design hotel, perfect location, nice staff, stylishly decorated. Just opened three months ago. Location in a quiet street in buzzling Soho. Breakfast service at your room which you pick the night before. Definitely recommended !","en"
"2000",4,"A very nice hotel in a very quiet location and yet close to all amenities. 5 mins walk from Euston Road and 10 mins walk from Oxford St. Lots of bars and restaurants to choose from. Our room was a little on the small side but very well furnished. Would definately stay there again","en"
